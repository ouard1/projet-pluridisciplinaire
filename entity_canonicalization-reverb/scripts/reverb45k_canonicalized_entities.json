Both his parents were artists who had met at art school in Paris. Merton first went to study at Cambridge, but left after only one year, and moved to the US, to study at Columbia University, where he converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1941 he entered the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, a community of Trappists monks, and stayed a part of the community for the rest of his life. He was a prolific writer, but it is his autobiography, &apos;The Seven Storey Mountain&apos;, which is most celebrated. In the 1960s, he became increasingly political and a strong supporter of the civil rights movement. His writings on the subject led to frequent criticism, especially from other Catholics. He also became very interested in Zen Buddhism, and in promoting East-West dialogue, and this led to him being praised by the Dali Lama. He died as a result of an accidental electrocution. Merton was a keen diarist, but prohibited the publishing of much of his writing until 25 years after his death. There are now many volumes of his published diaries.

After work I head downtown to the Baton Rouge shelter which is housed in the convention center. Baton Rouge is different than Kelly. In thinking back I think the way it seemed then was that Baton Rouge was a place to escape to and San Antonio was a place to start over from. There was much less hope in this place and more a sense of futility with the system, the rules and the attitudes that governed these displaced people. FEMA and the Red Cross disappeared at 5:00 and left 4,000 evacuees in the hands of volunteers and the National Guard - not the Louisiana Guard because they were in Iraq. We did the best we could for people who stayed in their homes hoping the flood waters would recede; or for those who ran out of cash and had to move out of hotels in Houston and Shreveport; and those who had been living in their cars. The line of people checking in was endless. One young couple had been living in their car and had returned to Baton Rouge to try to pick up paychecks. It&apos;s amazing what happens when there are no phones, you have no home and you are out of money. As I checked them in the woman asked if there was a chance we could find a stroller since she had been carrying her child everywhere for a week. I went to the supply area and found one. And, I found a teddy bear too. When I returned with the blankets, cots, stroller, teddy bear and MREs the woman cried in gratitude or relief. I found them a quiet corner to set up their temporary home. These are the points of light I remember, when my small actions were received with gratitude and I felt like I was really doing some good. I was surprised at the ungraciousness of the people of Baton Rouge toward their own State&apos;s displaced people. I guess I might feel different if my Ohio city doubled in size overnight and every person was unemployed and looking for a rest room. After I left the shelter for the night, I went to five ATMs before I found one with money and to three or four stores before I found one with linens and pillows. No grocery store had ice or bottled water. Baton Rouge was under siege mentality and the people acted like it!"], "triple": ["Baton Rouge", "is different than", "Kelly"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": null, "subject": "Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana"}, "_id": 9886}

In June 1941 Vacuum Oil and Royal Dutch Shell Oil entered into a deal with the Soviets wherein they would purchase oil from the Soviet Union. This infuriated the Standard Oil Companies of New Jersey, which was controlled by the Rockefeller family. The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey announced its refusal to buy oil from Soviet Russia until it recognizes private property rights. The New York Times reported: &quot;The Standard of New Jersey owns a 51% interest in the Nobel Company, a Russian oil unit that was nationalized along with the rest of the Russian petroleum interests after the Soviets took charge of the Government. The Standard of New Jersey had no substantial interests in Russia prior to the nationalization of the industry. The Standard of New Jersey, through its ownership of control of the Nobel Company has a claim against the Soviet Government.&quot; [NYT 1.16.28] The New York Times reported: &quot;The Rockefellers, who are largely interested in the Standard of New Jersey and the Vacuum Oil Company, are expected to use their influence to prevent any widening of the breach between the three companies.&quot; [NYT 7.26.27] In the 1930&apos;s, John J. McCloy became a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. During World War II, John J. McCloy was an Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, and supervised the Strategic Services Unit of the War Department in 1944. In 1945 he was appointed High Commissioner to Germany, the top-ranking United States official there. By 1947 John J. McCloy was an official in the Office of Policy Coordination. He worked closely with Frank Wisner on numerous CIA operations in post-war Europe. In the early 1950&apos;s John J. McCloy pardoned Nazi war criminals, despite protests from divergent quarters. When he returned to the United States, John J. McCloy resumed his role as the Attorney for the Rockefellers, and engineered the merger of the Chase and Manhattan Banks. The Chase Manhattan Bank was employed to launder CIA funds. John J. McCloy was installed as a Director of the Chase Manhattan Bank and a Director of the Rockefeller Foundation. John J. McCloy was a Director of United Fruit. In 1959 he worked with the CIA in funding anti-Communist activities at the Vienna World Youth Festival. He was a close friend of the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John McCone. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, John J. McCloy negotiated with the Russians. In 1964 John J. McCloy thought it was imperative to &quot;show the world that America is not a banana republic, where a government can be changed by a conspiracy.&quot; John J.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. This guide represents a work-in-progress. The original draft was completed by Project Archivist Peggy L. McMullen in September, 1988, finishing a complex, challenging, and difficult project begun by Arthur F. Sniffin in the fall of 1985. Throughout this period of arranging and describing elusive and sometimes indecipherable documents, we were able to draw on the expertise of Dr. Narayan Hegde. First as a graduate student, and subsequently as a consulting scholar, he had worked intermittently with the collection from its arrival at Stony Brook&apos;s Center for Contemporary Arts and Letters in 1975. Other graduate students who worked on the initial indexing of the collection in the mid-1970s were Linda Bauer, Terry Lichtenstein, and Jerry Schecter. Special Collections Department staff started planning for the housing and processing of the Yeats Collection in 1983. I am indebted to Rose C. Brown and Susan C. Rose for their continuing contributions to the overall planning, organizing, and housing of the collection, and for providing various kinds of support during the project. Timothy D. Cary and Lee R. Hiltzik also worked on many aspects of planning and implementing the project. Subsequently, Diane E. Englot has helped in revising and editing the collection.", "48.

He did some of his greatest work after he was 50 years old. Yeats was born in Dublin, Ireland, on June 13, 1865, the eldest son of an artist. Although the family soon moved to London, the children spent much time with their grandparents in County Sligo in northwestern Ireland. The scenery and folklore of this region greatly influenced Yeats&apos;s work. For a while he studied art, but during the 1890s he became active in London&apos;s literary life and helped found the Rhymers&apos; Club. Yeats&apos;s early work was not especially Irish. Soon, however, he began to look to the ancient rituals and pagan beliefs of the land for his artistic inspiration. He tried to merge this interest with his aristocratic tastes to create an original Irish poetry and to establish his own identity. In 1896 Yeats met Lady Gregory, an aristocrat and playwright who shared his interest in Ireland&apos;s past, especially in its folklore. In 1899 they formed a literary society that was the predecessor of the Abbey Theatre. Among his plays were &apos;The Countess Cathleen&apos; (1892) and &apos;Cathleen ni Houlihan&apos; (1902), with Maud Gonne originating the title role. In 1899 he had proposed to her, but she refused to marry him. He later proposed to her daughter, who also refused. A free Ireland was the object of the actress&apos; passion, and Yeats&apos;s love for her kindled his interest in the country&apos;s political struggles. From 1922 until 1928 he was a senator in the Dail Eireann, or Irish parliament."], "triple": ["Yeats", "was born in", "Dublin"], "kbp_info": [["PERSON", "per:city_of_birth", "LOCATION"]], "entity_linking": {"object": "Dublin", "subject": "William_Butler_Yeats"}, "_id": 116415}

It had been seared on a tiny hibachi grill until the proteins were just set and was, quite simply, the sweetest, most intense crab meat I had ever eaten. I was in no doubt. Tokyo was obviously the greatest food city in the world. I had been in town for three hours.This week, after a slightly more rigorous appraisal of the city&apos;s restaurants involving a year and a half&apos;s work and five full-time inspectors, the Michelin Guide confirmed what it had taken me half a dinner time to conclude. London&apos;s restaurants have 50 Michelin stars between them. Paris, birthplace of the grand restaurant, has 98. In its first ever guide to Tokyo, the Japanese capital has been awarded 191, spread across eight three-stars, 25 two-stars and a whopping 117 one-stars. It&apos;s official. Tokyo is belly heaven. Having spent a week eating around Tokyo earlier this year - lunch, dinner, lunch, dinner, lunch, lunch, dinner, dinner; I am nothing if not committed - I have only one doubt over this galaxy of Michelin stars: they really haven&apos;t awarded anywhere near enough of them. I went to Tokyo in search of the perfect meal for my new book, The Man Who Ate The World, about the globalisation of high-end restaurants. I had already played poker to win the price of a glass of Ch\u00e2teau d&apos;Yquem at Nobu in Las Vegas. I had cruised the mafia bling of Moscow and been fed Escoffier classics amid the ludicrous desert fantasies of Dubai. And in all of these cities identifying the high-end restaurants to visit had been easy. The list was always relatively short, relatively uncontroversial and generally included the words Gordon and Ramsay. Tokyo was entirely different. There are, according to whom you talk to, either 60,000, 160,00 or 300,000 restaurants there. All we can know for sure is that there are an Awful Lot Of Them. I asked a dozen knowledgeable people for a list of must-do restaurants. I got back a dozen different lists. (None of them included the words Gordon or Ramsay.) But each time I was also given a warning. They could tell me where it would be great to eat, but getting to do so was a different matter entirely. In the west, restaurants are relatively democratic affairs. If you can scrape together the cash, and book far enough in advance, you can go. Japanese high-end restaurants are not like that at all. For a start, many are tiny, seating fewer than a dozen people and sometimes just four or six. Second, they are seriously bloody choosy about who they feed. I approached a foodie friend, a San Francisco-based Thai food-blogger called Pim Techamuanvivit, whose blog, Chez Pim, has become a cult. She is seriously connected. She has eaten her way around Tokyo. How could I go about securing reservations, I asked. She laughed, and not in a good way. &quot;They won&apos;t let you in,&quot; she said. &quot;You&apos;re a round eye.&quot; In short, gaijin are not welcome. Hell, even being Japanese won&apos;t necessarily do it. Many places regard the right to be a customer as a privilege to be bestowed rather than bought for the cost of dinner. The very least you need is a personal introduction by an existing customer, and ideally a blood relationship, a certificate bearing the thumb prints of three European popes, and a winning smile. Oh, and shed loads of cash: \u00a3500 a head for dinner in one of these places is really not extraordinary. For all these reasons I had serious doubts when I heard that Michelin was scouring Tokyo for worthy recipients of its stars. The three French inspectors wouldn&apos;t have a hope in hell of making it inside the serious Japanese places, and the two local inspectors might not fare much better either. Eventually, to secure my bookings, I had to fall on the mercy of the executive chef at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, where I was staying; thank you, Mr Yamamoto. I couldn&apos;t have done it without you. Who was going to make all the introductions for the Michelin crew, who needed to visit anonymously? The results published this week appear to have borne out my concerns. The place where I ate that fabulous crab, Yukimura, a simple unprepossessing dining room on the third floor of a residential apartment block that could seat just nine, has made it into the guide. It has earned a single star for its extraordinary, multi-course set tasting menu of raw scallop with shaved, dried sea cucumber, raw venison the colour of a fresh haemorrhage, tiny white vinegared fish, crab legs and brown meat and a whole bunch of other things besides. The two other high-end Japanese restaurants I visited, which were of an equal quality, are nowhere to be seen. Michelin simply appears not to have found them. And no wonder. The sushi place where I ate, Okei, was the smallest high-end restaurant I visited in the course of researching my book. It served just one person that night (although it can seat six). That person was me. Oh, and the sushi was very, very good indeed. My 32 courses - seared belly tuna, grilled marinated clam, nigiri of sea bream and salmon and sea urchin - cost me \u00a3250. It felt like a bargain. Unsurprisingly, where Tokyo-based western restaurants are concerned, the professional eaters of Michelin appear to be on much more solid ground. One of the things that defines the city is its openness to other culinary traditions. Today, every big-name chef is setting up outposts in any global city with a smattering of spare cash. Tokyo has been at this game for decades, ever since the French uber-chef Paul Bocuse first toured the country in the late 1960s. As far back as the early 1970s, Maxim&apos;s of Paris, one of the first restaurants in the world to win three Michelin stars back in the 1930s, had an outpost on the ground floor of the Sony building in downtown Tokyo. Today, everybody from Alain Ducasse to Wolfgang Puck, Michel Troisgros to Pierre Gagnaire has successful restaurants in Tokyo and all have a few more stars this week than they had last. There is one exception to this list. Gordon Ramsay has a restaurant in Tokyo, at the Conrad Hotel. For the first time since he won his first stars at Aubergine in the mid-90s, Michelin has decided a Ramsay business is worth not even a single star. It is a major slap around the chops for the boy from Glasgow Rangers. The real winner is the Frenchman Joel Robuchon, who suddenly finds himself the proud owner of six more Michelin stars, spread across a three-star, a two-star and a one-star restaurant in Tokyo. It brings his global haul to 17. (Ducasse is just behind with 15.) It would be easy to dismiss this as the impeccably French tyre company looking after its own. Irritatingly, they have probably called it right, not least because Robuchon, once named chef of the century, understands the Japanese aesthetic better than almost any other western chef. Because here is the most interesting thing about the booming, intricate obsessive restaurant scene in Tokyo: it is now having a major impact on high-end gastronomy in the west. Today, any big-name chef worth their Maldon sea salt wouldn&apos;t be seen dead serving a mere starter-main-dessert three-course meal. Instead, it&apos;s about tasting menus of 12 or 20 or even 30 tiny courses. That is a direct lift from the Japanese tradition of multi-course menus. Likewise, the introduction of smaller courses draws chefs back to less intricate plates, pointing up single ingredients, very much a part of the Japanese aesthetic. And the fashion for hot jellies and foams, made popular by the likes of Heston Blumenthal of the Fat Duck in Bray and Ferran Adri\u00e0 of El Bulli in Spain, draws on seaweed extracts which have been known to Japanese chefs for decades. Not that the eaters of Tokyo will give a damn about any of this. Nor, indeed, are they likely to care much what Michelin thinks of their city&apos;s restaurants. They didn&apos;t need the French to come and tell them just how good the eating opportunities are in their town. They&apos;ve always known. This Michelin Guide is for the rest of us, or at least those of us who care just a little too much about our dinner. We can only flick through its pages, read the descriptions of food we are never likely to be able to eat, and dream. Where to eat, what to eat ... and why the food&apos;s so good Japanese food experts give the lowdown on dining out in Tokyo Kanehiro Takase Head chef at Matsuri St James&apos;s, London &quot;There are three issues at heart here. The most important thing is the very good quality of the ingredients that you can get hold of in Tokyo if you are prepared to pay the prices. This applies to fish, meat, vegetables and fruit. In addition to this there is an innate awareness of Japanese people with regard to the safe preparation of the ingredients. Finally, the Japanese have a very strong passion for food and do not mind paying high prices to eat it if it&apos;s delicious. &quot;If visitors are looking for something tasty but which is good value for money, they should eat around the famous Tsukiji market. I recommend eating sushi in one of the restaurants there or donburi [rice with a topping such as meat or eel]. If they are happy to pay a lot of money to dine well, then there are lots of very good restaurants in Ginza. I recommend eating tempura at a specialist tempura restaurant, such as Ten-ichi or Tenkuni.&quot; Ichiro Kubota Head chef at Uma, London &quot;Michelin is French and can easily assess French restaurants, but I think their guides to other places in the world are more commercial than authentic. I know two of their judges were Japanese, but even so ... In Japan there is so much diverstity. There are sushi restaurants, tempura restaurants and kaiseki restaurants which, like French restaurants, are based on tasting menus comprised of seven to 10 dishes. Kaiseki is a completely different world from sushi. However, Michelin generalised all the cuisine as &apos;Japanese&apos;. &quot;Japanese cuisine is much more profound than everyone thinks. French food is renowned all over the world and translates very well, whereas kaiseki comes from the beginnings of Japanese culture. You have to understand the philosophies of ancient tea ceremonies to appreciate the service, host, dish and chef. And you have to know about the ingredients. For example, each colour means something: carrot and raddish mean &apos;celebration&apos;, yellow kombu [seaweed] is for new year&apos;s eve because it means &apos;happy&apos;, or &apos;to laugh&apos;. &quot;The best foods to try in Kyoto are simple edo mai-sushi, which is hand-pressed nigiri made with rice and raw fish. Edo mai means &apos;in front of Tokyo Bay&apos; - they use fish freshly caught from the bay. And Kamoseiro is soba noodles made from buckwheat, mixed with soup stock and duck fat - giving it a rich taste - and served warm with duck.&quot; Janina Wolkow Owner of Sumosan restaurant, London &quot;I wish Michelin had written this guide sooner, as it would have helped on my Tokyo trips. The last time I went with my head chef we literally did dinner twice each evening because there were so many places we wanted to try. Be warned, though: if you go to restaurants that aren&apos;t designed for foreigners, no one will speak English, so all you can do is point to things on the menu and hope for the best. &quot;The raw materials in Tokyo are amazing. Even the beef section in a supermarket can be breathtaking and would turn a non-vegetarian into a meat eater. The best things I ate in Tokyo were seafood kimchi (actually a Korean dish made with spicy, fermented cabbage) that was served on a hollowed grapefruit. Through the flavoursome marinade, you could still taste the freshness of the fish. There was a knife stuck through the grapefruit, which they pulled out as they served it, to release dry ice. And the clams on the sushi they serve are still alive. We just don&apos;t get that over here.&quot; Malcolm Simpson General manager of Bincho Yakitori in London&apos;s Oxo Tower &quot;Unlike here, you won&apos;t find different kinds of Japanese food in one restaurant. There, one will serve, for example, yakitori - chicken skewers - and another will do only sushi. There are 80,000 bars and restaurants there and they&apos;re often piled eight stories high on top of each other. You have to look up to find them. &quot;There are two kinds of fine dining there: restaurants for the rich expat market and then the true fine dining aimed at anyone who has money. The Japanese are very much into trying things new and western and they demand everything to be authentic. So Joel Robuchon, who won three stars for his French restaurant there, imports everything. The clientele demands that and don&apos;t mind paying for it. My best Tokyo food experience was at Tsukiji fish market near Tokyo Bay. Some Japanese friends and I paid \u00a350 for two big bricks of tuna, which we chopped up and ate on the spot with some wasabi and soy sauce.&quot; Hiroyuki Saotome Executive chef of Saki, London &quot;The [Michelin] selection is skewed toward more contemporary and creative Japanese restaurants [more appealing to non-Japanese customers] with a wide selection of wine. This is why the list looks kind of surprising for those who are used to appreciating the authentic Japanese eateries. &quot;What makes Tokyo stand out is the ingredients. Restaurateurs and shops only accept the freshest quality and don&apos;t hesitate to return whatever whenever the quality doesn&apos;t satisfy them. &quot;In London, it is a continuous struggle and you have to keep telling your suppliers what our quality standards are. In Japan, it is a completely different game altogether. The particular difference is the fish. For vegetables, I can find great quality [here in Britain], even better than those I find in Japan. However, when it comes to fish, the difference is like heaven and hell. &quot;[As for] one dish to eat in Tokyo, this is a very difficult question. In Tokyo, if you plan to dine in a very good Japanese restaurant, you don&apos;t come to eat a &apos;dish&apos; but the &apos;season&apos;. &quot;But if I had to suggest just one dish to take away from your whole Tokyo experience, there are so many good things to try, but just for the reason that it is is only available in Japan, I would pick fugu [the potentially deadly blowfish].&quot; \u00b7 Interviews by Amy Fleming and Homa Khaleeli \u00b7 Jay Rayner is the Observer&apos;s restaurant critic.

Z Maurice Maeterlinck Biography Maurice Polydore Marie Bernard Maeterlinck (August 29, 1862 - May 6, 1949) was a Belgian poet, playwright, and essayist. Biography Maurice Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, in a wealthy, French-speaking family. He wrote poems and short novels during his studies, which he destroyed later; only fragments are left. After finishing his law studies, he spent a few months in Paris, France. He met there some members of the then new Symbolism movement, Villiers de l&apos;Isle Adam in particular. The latter would have a big influence on the work of Maeterlinck. He became famous with his play La princesse Maleine in 1890, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911. Main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. He had a relationship with the singer Georgette Leblanc from 1895 till 1918. In 1919 he married Ren\u00c3\u00a9e Dahon; together they went to the United States. In 1930 he bought a ch\u00c3\u00a2teau in Nice, France, and named it Orlamonde, a name occurring in his work Quinze Chansons. He was made a count by King Albert I of Belgium in 1932.

Tentatively titled The Search for the Next American Band, the show will have the same format as Idol, taking bands of all ages, genres, and styles through an audition phase, a secondary phase in which judges narrow the field to 10, followed by a finalist phase voted on by viewers. Three bands will compete in the show&apos;s finale. The show will also dig into the bands&apos; personal stories and focus on their interpersonal relationships and conflicts. Idol creator Simon Fuller created the new show and will executive produce with Idol producers Nigel Lythgoe, Ken Warwick, and Cecile Frot-Coutaz. Lythgoe and Warwick recently announced that they were stepping down as producers of the Emmys broadcast to focus on other projects. FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment will also produce. The show was announced on Wednesday&apos;s (May 9) results episode of American Idol. There is no airdate set, but the producers are trying to ready the new show for a once-a-week airing starting this fall. The Halcyon Co., Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek&apos;s new privately-financed production company, has acquired all rights to the Terminator franchise and plans to make a new trilogy. Terminator 4, which will be based on a script by T3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, picks up with John Connor in his 30s leading what&apos;s left of the human race against the machines. The producers plan to start preproduction immediately for a planned first-half 2009 release. No director or cast has been selected yet, but it is expected that the new trilogy will reinvent the franchise with new actors and plotlines. ( ) Eddie Murphy will star in multiple roles in a film adaptation of Fantasy Island for Columbia Pictures. The project will turn the popular TV series, which ran from 1978-84 and starred Ricardo Montalban, into a family comedy. Jay Scherick and David Ronn are writing. They most recently teamed with Murphy on Norbit. Murphy is currently featured repsiring his role as the voice of Donkey in the third installment of Shrek, and he will next be seen in 20th Century Fox&apos;s comedy Starship Dave. ( ) Luke Wilson will star in the dramedy Henry Poole Is Here for Lakeshore Entertainment and director Mark Pellington (The Mothman Prophecies). Wilson will play a man who discovers he has only six weeks to live and decides he wants to just disappear into suburbia and live on a diet of pizza, Twinkies, and vodka. The project will be shopped at this year&apos;s Cannes. Wilson will next be seen in The Wendell Baker Story, which he wrote and co-directed, and You Kill Me, alongside Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. ( ) The U. S. Treasury Department is investigating filmmaker Michael Moore for taking Sept. 11 rescue workers to Cuba in his upcoming health-care documentary Sicko. The Treasury Department&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control notified Moore in a letter dated May 2 that it was conducting a civil investigation for possible violations of the U.S. trade embargo restricting travel to Cuba, according to the Associated Press. In February, Moore took ailing workers from the Ground Zero rescue effort in Manhattan for treatment in Cuba, according to a person the AP says worked with the filmmaker on the release of Sicko. No potential penalties were specified, but in 2003, the New York Yankees paid the government $75,000 to settle a dispute that it conducted business in violation of the Cuba embargo. ( ) Matthew Perry, Hilary Swank tapped for indie comedy Matthew Perry and Hilary Swank have been tapped for Laws of Motion, an indie comedy from Plum Pictures, Ideal Partners Film Fund, and Hilary Swank Prods. Ben Foster (Six Feet Under) is also in talks to star. Perry will play a husband struggling with his career and his free-spirited brother (Foster) and sister. Swank play a supporting role as the all-too-perfect neighbor of Perry&apos;s harried character. Production is scheduled to start this month. Perry&apos;s most recent movie, Numb, premiered at Tribeca this year. Swank will next be seen in Warner Bros. &apos; P.S. I Love You with Gerald Butler, and she will also produce Labyrinth for Summit Entertainment, a thriller in which she might also star. ( ) Tim Roth will play Emil Blonsky, the alter ego of Abomination, the Hulk&apos;s adversary in the upcoming movie adaptation. Blonsky is a KGB agent who deliberately exposes himself to the gamma rays that caused Bruce Banner to turn into the Hulk. Blonsky ups the dosage, making him larger and stronger than the Hulk, but he is also unable to change back to human form. He blames Banner for the problem and vows to destroy the Hulk. Roth joins Edward Norton, who plays Banner, and Liv Tyler in the Louis Leterrier-directed drama, which is due June 13, 2008.

Richard Clarke&apos;s account in his book, &quot;Against All Enemies,&quot; corroborates Mineta&apos;s timeline, which was evidently so threatening to the official story that Mineta&apos;s testimony was deleted from the 9/11 Commission video archives. General Richard Myers contradicted his own story in several incarnations of his alibi as did Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, both of whom claimed to be unaware of unfolding events when, according to Richard Clarke, they were both participating in a live video teleconference initiated by Clarke at about 9:10. Griffin skillfully analyzes these contradictory versions of events. The Commission&apos;s claim that the FAA did not notify the military early enough to scramble jets was contradicted by the FAA&apos;s assertion that not only was a military liaison present throughout its nationwide alert but &quot;within minutes after the first aircraft hit the World Trade Center it immediately established several phone bridges that included.DOD, the Secret Service, and other government agencies.&quot; NORAD&apos;s original (September 18, 2001) timeline corroborated FAA statements as did military officers, such as the National Military Command Center&apos;s Brigadier General Montague Winfield and NORAD&apos;s Captain Michael Jellinek. One also learns from Richard Clarke that the &quot;Secret Service had a system that allowed them to see what FAA&apos;s radar was seeing.&quot; The 9/11 Commission&apos;s claim, therefore, would be laughable had the consequences of this lie not been so tragic. Griffin presents extensive eye-witness accounts by firefighters, police officers, journalists and building workers who gave vivid reports of hearing and seeing powerful sequential explosions within all three of the World Trade Center skyscrapers prior to their collapse. Building 7, which was not hit by a plane, also collapsed symmetrically into its own footprint around 5:20 pm - an event that was anticipated and communicated to firefighters by Mayor Giuliani&apos;s Office of Emergency Management around noon. Griffin poses the question to NIST, the agency tasked by the Commission with explaining the destruction of the Twin Towers and WTC7, how OEM could have known so many hours in advance that the building would collapse. Further evidence of controlled demolition is suggested by three professors at Worcester Polytechnic Institute who noted the peculiar characteristics of oxidation and sulfidation on salvaged WTC steel beams. NIST admitted that the temperature of the fires was insufficient (by at least 1000\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdF) to melt steel. However, if thermate cutter charges (thermite plus sulfur) were used to slice the steel framework, that would explain the molten steel. How did NIST and the 9/11 Commission explain the eyewitness testimony that steel had melted? By not mentioning it. Several chapters are devoted to exposing contradictions concerning the alleged hijackers. The assertion that Hani Hanjour could have flown American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon after making a spectacular 330\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd turn over prohibited airspace is demonstrably preposterous given his record of total incompetence as a pilot. The profile of Mohamed Atta as a devout Muslim on a sacred suicide mission is contradicted by numerous eye-witnesses who described his unholy lifestyle in vivid detail. The FBI&apos;s assertion that Atta&apos;s personal belongings provided a treasure trove of incriminating evidence (a Koran, his Will and a list of the 19 hijackers) is dubious, given the FBI&apos;s inconsistent versions of where this miraculous proof was found. It was first reportedly found in a white Mitsubishi at Logan airport in Boston. That story was changed when a subsequent tale proved to be false. After the FBI claimed that two hijackers named Bukhari had driven a blue Nissan to Portland, Maine, and then taken a commuter flight back to Boston on the morning of 9/11, it was discovered that one Bukhari had died the previous year and the other was still alive. The FBI clumsily merged these stories by claiming that Atta drove the blue Nissan to Portland and then took the commuter flight back. In this new story, the incriminating evidence was &quot;found&quot; in his luggage, which failed to get transferred to Flight 11. The public belief that Middle Eastern men hijacked the planes was based heavily on media reports of over 15 cell phone calls from passengers to relatives, although high-altitude cell phone calls were not possible in 2001. One source of the hijacker tale came from the Justice Department&apos;s Solicitor General, Ted Olson, who told CNN that his wife (Barbara) had called him twice from American Flight 77. That claim was contradicted at the Zacarias Moussaoui trial in 2006 when the FBI reported that only two cell phone calls were made from all four planes, and that both calls originated from United Flight 93 (after it had descended to 5,000 feet). How did the Commission reconcile FBI records with reports from family members who recognized Caller IDs made from cell phones? It omitted the FBI records. Why do these contradictions matter? The story of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and nineteen Muslim hijackers is based entirely on unverified claims. Despite promises of forthcoming evidence, the US government has yet to deliver any hard evidence. To this day, the FBI&apos;s web page concerning Osama bin Laden does not accuse him of involvement with the 9/11 attacks. Why not? An FBI official has admitted, &quot;The FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.&quot; What, then, is the justification for attacking two sovereign nations and killing over one million civilians? Although Griffin refrains from making direct accusations, he methodically presents objective evidence that leads the reader to an inevitable conclusion ~ that the purpose of the 9/11 Commission was to assign guilt where it did not exist and to cover up guilt where it did, thereby obstructing criminal indictments for treason, mass murder, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes against the earth. Griffin&apos;s impeccable research should inspire public demand for an independent investigation of 9/11. The enormous public service Griffin has provided in preparing this meticulous archive cannot be over-stated. Any investigative journalist worthy of that title would need only to validate this archive of facts. With the precision and skill of a seasoned District Attorney, David Ray Griffin presents a case that is so well organized it could be used intact by any prosecutor devoted to uncovering the truth.

The John Mark in Acts (xii, 12, 25; xv, 37) mentioned as John (xiii, 5, 13) and as Mark (xv, 39) is surely the Mark mentioned by Paul (Colossians., iv, 10; II Tim., iv, 11; Philem., 24) and by Peter in I Peter, v, 13. Mark of the Pauline Epistles was the cousin (anepsios) of Barnabas (Colossians., iv, 10), to whom Mark of Acts seems to have been bound by some special tie (Acts, xv, 37, 39). Mark&apos;s mother was a prominent member of the earliest group of Christians in Jerusalem; it was to her house that Peter turned on his release from prison; the house was approached by a porch (pulon), there was a slave girl (paidiske) to open the door, and the house was a meeting-place for the brethren, &quot;many&quot; of whom were praying there the night St. Peter arrived from prison (Acts, xii, 12-13). (text based on N.T. sources) A further report of Mark as the amanuensis of Peter and the Secret Gospel of Mark is given in a letter of Clement of Alexandria (died ca 211 - 216), transcribed into a printed book in the monastery of Mar Saba, south of Jerusalem. In it Clement states\\ :&quot;&quot;As for Mark, then, during Peter&apos;s stay in Rome he wrote an account of the Lord&apos;s doings, not, however, declaring all of them, nor yet hinting at the secret ones, but selecting what he thought most useful for increasing the faith of those who were being instructed. But when Peter died a martyr, Mark came over to Alexandria, bringing both his own notes and those of Peter, from which he transferred to his former book the things suitable to whatever makes for progress toward knowledge. Thus he composed a more spiritual Gospel for the use of those who were being perfected. Nevertheless, he yet did not divulge the things not to be uttered, nor did he write down the hierophantic teaching of the Lord, but to the stories already written he added yet others and, moreover, brought in certain sayings of which he knew the interpretation would, as a mystagogue, lead the hearers into the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by seven veils. Thus, in sum, he prepared matters, neither grudgingly nor incautiously, in my opinion, and, dying, he left his composition to the church in Alexandria, where it even yet is most carefully guarded, being read only to those who are being initiated into the great mysteries.&quot; Legendary details \\ An extensive and satisfyingly circumstantial account of Mark&apos;s life was written by Severus, Bishop of Al-Ushmunain, in the 10th century. According to this account, Mark was the nephew of Barnabas, who was cousin to Peter&apos;s wife. Mark was one of the servants at the wedding feast at Cana who poured out the water that Jesus Christ turned to wine. This is Jesus&apos; first public miracle, however it is not related in the Gospel of Mark. Mark was one of the Seventy Apostles sent out by Christ; he was the servant who carried water to the house of Simon the Cyrenian, where the Last Supper took place; and Mark was the one who hosted the disciples in his house after the death of Jesus, and into whose house the resurrected Jesus Christ came, although all the doors were shut. The following details are also based on Severus&apos; account, and need corroboration before they are accepted as more than 10th century pious legend: He eventually went to Alexandria and was the first to preach the Gospel there. He is said to have performed many miracles, and established a church there, appointing a bishop, three priests, and seven deacons. Mark is considered by this writer to have founded the School of Alexandria, a school that encouraged studies in science, philosophy, music, math and language embraced by the early Copts, who believe such disciplines are not contrary to religion, but lead believers to a true spiritual life. The pagan Library and Musaeum are ignored. When Mark returned to Alexandria, the people there are said to have resented his efforts to turn them away from the worship of their traditional Egyptian gods. In 68 A.D. they killed him, and tried to burn his body. Afterwards, the Christians in Alexandria removed his unburned body from the ashes, wrapped it and then buried it in the easterly part of the church they had built. His remains were later stolen and taken to Venice. They were not returned to Egypt until 1968. However, the first reports of his execution by burning date to the 4th century and are considered apocryphal by many church historians. It should be noted that Severus&apos; account is not entirely reconcilable with the first accounts we have of St. Mark. Papias says that he was a disciple of Peter and never knew Jesus himself. Papias says Mark wrote down the stories Peter told, but not necessarily in chronological order. It is unlikely that the early church would remember a story which made the authorship of Mark&apos;s Gospel seem less authoritative than it was. Representations in Western art \\  depicts St Mark as a lion in front of the city of Venice.]]\\ Mark is frequently depicted in Western art, especially Renaissance art. Like the other 3 evangelists, he is often shown holding a book, but his special attribute is the winged lion. As the patron saint of Venice, he was a particular favorite of Venetian artists and their patrons, and paintings of his life and miracles are a feature of some of the greatest Venetian art. His lion is ubiquitous throughout Venice.

Citrulline Malate (CM) also boosts energy levels at the cellular level, eliminates metabolic pollutants such as ammonia and lactic acid (produced from all exercise), supports immune health and as mentioned increases arginine production to fuel NO output. MRM&apos;s unique selection of Arginine Di Malate as well as Citrulline Malate was well researched. Malate supports the recycling of lactate and pyruvate and is greatly involved in the kreb&apos;s cycle. Most importantly, malate boosts and maintains our energy cycle. In addition, CM has shown to support recovery after exercise by stimulating phosphocreatine reuptake leading to faster recovery between workouts. Guanidino Propionic Acid (GPA) is a phenomenal ingredient added to Metabolic Pump. GPA has shown to mimic the action of insulin without the need for high glycemic carbohydrates. This insulin mimicking action efficiently transports nutrients throughout the body, supports glucose reuptake into the muscle and efficiently shuttles creatine into the muscle cell. With over 15 years of prominent and positive research on creatine monohydrate, MRM has chosen to stick with science and utilize the monohydrate form of creatine to support recovery and muscle growth. VasoPhenol was developed by MRM to further enhance vasodilation, vascularity and muscle pump with the clinically proven benefits of grape seed and ginkgo biloba.

His father \u2014 a man of great talent \u2014 was a lawyer, strongly imbued with French eighteenth-century ideas of religion, science, and art; his mother was the descendant of Hungarian Jews, who in the seventeenth century settled in Holland. Amongst his earliest friends and playmates were Jenny \u2014 afterwards his wife \u2014 and Edgar von Westphalen. From their father, the Baron von Westphalen \u2014 himself half a Scot \u2014 Karl Marx imbibed his first love for the \u201cRomantic\u201d School, and while his father read him Voltaire and Racine, Westphalen read him Homer and Shakespere. These always remained his favorite writers. At once much loved and feared by his school-fellows \u2014 loved because he was always in mischief, and feared because of his readiness in writing satirical verse and lampooning his enemies, Karl Marx passed through the usual school routine, and then proceeded to the Universities of Bonn and Berlin, where, to please his father, he for a time studied law, and to please himself he studied history and philosophy. In 1842 he was about to habilitate himself at Bonn as \u201cPrivat Dozent,\u201d but the political movement arisen in Germany since the death of Frederick William III. in 1840, threw him into another career. The chiefs of the Rhenish Liberals \u2014 Kamphausen and Hansemann \u2014 had founded the Rhenish Gazette at Cologne, with the co-operation of Marx, whose brilliant and bold criticism of the provincial Landtag created such a sensation, that, though only twenty-four years old, he was offered the chief editorship of the paper. He accepted it, and therewith began his long struggle with all despotisms, and with Prussian despotism in particular. Of course the paper appeared under the supervision of a censor \u2014 but the poor censor found himself powerless. The Gazette invariably published all important articles, and the censor could do nothing. Then a second, a \u201cspecial\u201d one was sent from Berlin, but even this double censorship proved of no avail, and finally in 1843 the government simply suppressed the paper altogether. In the same year, 1843, Marx had married his old friend and playfellow, to whom he had been engaged for seven years, Jenny von Westphalen, and with his young wife proceeded to Paris. Here, together with Arnold Ruge, he published the Deutsche Franzische Jahrbher, in which he began the long series of his socialist writings. His first contribution was a critique on Hegel\u2019s \u201cRechts-philosophie;\u201d the second, an essay on the \u201cJewish Question.\u201d When the Jahrbher ceased to appear, Marx contributed to the journal Votwtz, of which he is usually said to have been the editor. As a matter of fact, the editorship of this paper to which Heine, Everbeck, Engels, etc., contributed, seems to have been carried on in a somewhat erratic manner, and a really responsible editor never existed.

Soon afterwards the paper was also forced to stop publication. Marx then went to Paris (where he first met Engels). His radicalism had come to be recognizably &apos;communistic&apos;. His revolutionary analysis and activity led to him being ordered to leave Paris in 1845. Karl Marx went onto settle in Brussels and began to organize Communist Correspondence Committees in a number of European cities. This led to the organizing of the Communist League (and the writing of the Communist Manifesto with Engels) (see below). With the unrest and revolutionary activity of 1848, Marx was again forced to leave a country. He returned to Paris and then to the Rhineland. In Cologne he set up and edited the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, and continued organizing. In 1849 Marx was arrested and tried on a charge of incitement to armed insurrection.

In reality it is very simple. Hegel says that in the theoretical analysis of anything, which for him means a study of it in its self-development and inevitable self-transformation, do not do what Carter does constantly, check off a list of items, in other words \u201cthe multiplicity and contingency of the phenomenal\u201d, the ever-changing outward historical forms. He says: seek its notion, that inner relation from which all external developments must flow until this inner contradiction is abolished. Marx reduces his analysis of capitalist production to an ever-wonderful miracle of notional simplicity, stripped of all contingency: less and less of the day\u2019s labor going to the worker, more and more going to the other moment, or active factor, the machinery. This is the mark of capitalist production and when Carter quotes Marx to show that I confuse all types of society, I realise with deep concern the gulf that separates us, not on Russia, but on historical materialism and Capital. For although debate on Russia is understandable, it is a miserable business when you have to stop to explain that this sharp relation within the working-day has nothing to do with, e.g., feudalism. That rapidly developing relation and its laws form for Marx the \u201cinner nature\u201d of capital, and the consequences were analysed by Marx with a logical direction, a mastery of his material and a vivid concreteness, equalled nowhere except in the arrogance and obtuseness with which it is ignored. The self-expanding value expands itself according to its \u201cnotion\u201d, accumulated labor devouring living labor. Marx was supremely confident that he had found here the notion of the \u201cstrict process of production\u201d, the abstract logical relation around whose development all future historical society would revolve (as it did not revolve in the past) until the abolition of the capitalist system of production. For the word abolition, aufhebung, Marx went again to Hegel, to show quite clearly what he had in mind. Aufhebung is second in Hegelian importance only to Begriff.

He was then partner in a firm which his father had established. Like Marx, he had fled to London from the Continent, after the failure of the revolution,[1] and he still took a part in political agitation, and still studied.

If they did not go out they would stay together for one or two hours to talk walking up and down in Marx\u2019s study, each walking diagonally across the room. I remember a discussion on the Albigenses which lasted for several days. Marx had studied the part played in the Middle Ages by the Jewish and Christian financiers. When they were not together they used to study the same subjects in order to communicate to each other the results of their researches. They had the highest opinion of each other and did not think so highly of criticisms from other sources.

The Communist League was no more. Only a small number of workers remained clustering about the Communist Workers&apos; Educational Society and eking out a precarious living as tailors and compositors. Only at the end of 1851 an opportunity to write for the New York Tribune suddenly presented itself to Marx. The New York Tribune was then one of the most influential papers. Charles Dana, one of the editors of the Tribune, who had been in Germany and who had met Marx during the Revolution of 1848, invited Marx to write a series of articles on Germany for the paper. Dana had been in Cologne and he knew the important position Marx occupied among the German journalists. Having taken to heart the interests of his German readers (German immigration into the United States during the Revolution had greatly increased), Dana decided for their benefit to enlarge the section of the Tribune dealing with Western Europe. This unforeseen invitation brought in its train some embarrassments, for at that time Marx was not yet able to write English. He turned to Engels for help, and a very curious form of collaboration was established. We have already seen that the Communist Manifesto, though it appeared under the joint names of Marx and Engels, was overwhelmingly the work of Marx. Engels&apos; contribution to it was almost as little as had been his contribution to their common work, The Holy Family. Now it was Engels who performed the major task. His articles were later collected into a separate volume called Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany. Marx was credited with this book, but from their correspondence we now know that Engels was the author. However, ideologically it was the common work of Marx and Engels. The latter wrote it on the basis of ideas and facts that were supplied by Marx, and chiefly on the basis of the articles which they had both been writing for the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Thus began Marx&apos;s relations with the New York Tribune.

Despite their criticism of Hegel&apos;s metaphysical assumptions, they made use of Hegel&apos;s dialectical method, separated from its theological content, as a powerful weapon for the critique of established religion and politics. Some members of this circle drew an analogy between post-Aristotelian philosophy and post-Hegelian philosophy. One of them, Max Stirner, turned critically against both Feuerbach and Bauer in his book &quot;Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum&quot; (1845, The Ego and Its Own), calling these atheists &quot;pious people&quot; for their reification of abstract concepts. Marx, at that time a follower of Feuerbach, was deeply impressed by the work and abandoned Feuerbachian materialism and accomplished what recent authors have denoted as an &quot;epistemological break.&quot; He developed the basic concept of historical materialism against Stirner in his book &quot;Die Deutsche Ideologie&quot; (1846, The German Ideology), which he did not publish. Another link to the Young Hegelians was Moses Hess, with whom Marx eventually disagreed, yet to whom he owed many of his insights into the relationship between state, society and religion.

Marx, Karl, was born on May 5, 1818 (New Style), in the city of Trier (Rhenish Prussia). His father was a lawyer, a Jew, who in 1824 adopted Protestantism. The family was well-to-do, cultured, but not revolutionary. After graduating from a Gymnasium in Trier, Marx entered the university, first at Bonn and later in Berlin, where he read law, majoring in history and philosophy. He concluded his university course in 1841, submitting a doctoral thesis on the philosophy of Epicurus. At the time Marx was a Hegelian idealist in his views. In Berlin, he belonged to the circle of &quot;Left Hegelians&quot; (Bruno Bauer and others) who sought to draw atheistic and revolutionary conclusion from Hegel&apos;s philosophy. After graduating, Marx moved to Bonn, hoping to become a professor. However, the reactionary policy of the government, which deprived Ludwig Feuerbach of his chair in 1832, refused to allow him to return to the university in 1836, and in 1841 forbade young Professor Bruno Bauer to lecture at Bonn, made Marx abandon the idea of an academic career. Left Hegelian views were making rapid headway in Germany at the time. Feuerbach began to criticize theology, particularly after 1836, and turn to materialism, which in 1841 gained ascendancy in his philosophy (The Essence of Christianity). The year 1843 saw the appearance of his Principles of the Philosophy of the Future. &quot;One must oneself have experienced the liberating effect&quot; of these books, Engels subsequently wrote of these works of Feuerbach. &quot;We [i.e., the Left Hegelians, including Marx] all became at once Feuerbachians.&quot; At that time, some radical bourgeois in the Rhineland, who were in touch with the Left Hegelians, founded, in Cologne, an opposition paper called Rheinische Zeitung (The first issue appeared on January 1, 1842). Marx and Bruno Bauer were invited to be the chief contributors, and in October 1842 Marx became editor-in-chief and moved from Bonn to Cologne. The newspaper&apos;s revolutionary-democratic trend became more and more pronounced under Marx&apos;s editorship, and the government first imposed double and triple censorship on the paper, and then on January 1 1843 decided to suppress it. Marx had to resign the editorship before that date, but his resignation did not save the paper, which suspended publication in March 1843. Of the major articles Marx contributed to Rheinische Zeitung, Engels notes, in addition to those indicated below (see Bibliography), an article on the condition of peasant winegrowers in the Moselle Valley.[1] Marx&apos;s journalistic activities convinced him that he was insufficiently acquainted with political economy, and he zealously set out to study it. In 1843, Marx married, at Kreuznach, a childhood friend he had become engaged to while still a student. His wife came of a reactionary family of the Prussian nobility, her elder brother being Prussia&apos;s Minister of the Interior during a most reactionary period1850-58. In the autumn of 1843, Marx went to Paris in order to publish a radical journal abroad, together with Arnold Ruge (1802-1880); Left Hegelian; in prison in 1825-30; a political exile following 1848, and a Bismarckian after 1866-70). Only one issue of this journal, Deutsch-Franz\ufffdsische Jahrb\ufffdcher, appeared;[2] publication was discontinued owing to the difficulty of secretly distributing it in Germany, and to disagreement with Ruge. Marx&apos;s articles in this journal showed that he was already a revolutionary who advocated &quot;merciless criticism of everything existing&quot;, and in particular the &quot;criticism by weapon&quot;,[3] and appealed to the masses and to the proletariat. In September 1844, Frederick Engels came to Paris for a few days, and from that time on became Marx&apos;s closest friend. They both took a most active part in the then seething life of the revolutionary groups in Paris (of particular importance at the time was Proudhon&apos;s[4] doctrine), which Marx pulled to pieces in his Poverty of Philosophy, 1847); waging a vigorous struggle against the various doctrines of petty-bourgeois socialism, they worked out the theory and tactics of revolutionary proletarian socialism, or communism Marxism). See Marx&apos;s works of this period, 1844-48 in the Bibliography. At the insistent request of the Prussian government, Marx was banished from Paris in 1845, as a dangerous revolutionary. He went to Brussels. In the spring of 1847 Marx and Engels joined a secret propaganda society called the Communist League;[5] they took a prominent part in the League&apos;s Second Congress (London, November 1847), at whose request they drew up the celebrated Communist Manifesto, which appeared in February 1848. With the clarity and brilliance of genius, this work outlines a new world-conception, consistent with materialism, which also embrace the realm of social life; dialectics, as the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development; the theory of the class struggle and of the world-historic revolutionary role of the proletariatthe creator of a new, communist society. On the outbreak of the Revolution of February 1848,[6] Marx was banished from Belgium. He returned to Paris, whence, after the March Revolution,[7] he went to Cologne, Germany, where Neue Rheinische Zeitung[8] was published from June 1, 1848, to May 19, 1849, with Marx as editor-in-chief. The new theory was splendidly confirmed by the course of the revolutionary events of 1848-49, just as it has been subsequently confirmed by all proletarian and democratic movements in all countries of the world. The victorious counter-revolution first instigated court proceedings against Marx (he was acquitted on February 9, 1849), and then banished him from Germany (May 16, 1849). First Marx went to Paris, was again banished after the demonstration of June 13, 1849,[9] and then went to London, where he lived until his death. His life as a political exile was a very hard one, as the correspondence between Marx and Engels (published in 1913) clearly reveals. Poverty weighed heavily on Marx and his family; had it not been for Engels&apos; constant and selfless financial aid, Marx would not only have been unable to complete Capital but would have inevitably have been crushed by want. Moreover, the prevailing doctrines and trends of petty-bourgeois socialism, and of non-proletarian socialism in general, forced Marx to wage a continuous and merciless struggle and sometime to repel the most savage and monstrous personal attacks (Herr Vogt).[10] Marx, who stood aloof from circles of political exiles, developed his materialist theory in a number of historical works (see Bibliography), devoting himself mainly to a study of political economy. Marx revolutionized science (see &quot;The Marxist Doctrine&quot;, below) in his Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859) and Capital (Vol. I, 1867). The revival of the democratic movements in the late fifties and in the sixties recalled Marx to practical activity. In 1864 (September 28) the International Working Men&apos;s Associationthe celebrated First Internationalwas founded in London. Marx was the heart and soul of this organization, and author of its first Address[11] and of a host of resolutions, declaration and manifestoes. In uniting the labor movement of various forms of non-proletarian, pre-Marxist socialism (Mazzini, Proudhon, Bakunin, liberal trade-unionism in Britain, Lassallean vacillations to the right in Germany, etc.), and in combating the theories of all these sects and schools, Marx hammered out a uniform tactic for the proletarian struggle of the working in the various countries. Following the downfall of the Paris Commune (1871)of which gave such a profound, clear-cut, brilliant effective and revolutionary analysis (The Civil War In France, 1871)and the Bakunin-caused[12] cleavage in the International, the latter organization could no longer exist in Europe. After the Hague Congress of the International (1872), Marx had the General Council of the International had played its historical part, and now made way for a period of a far greater development of the labor movement in all countries in the world, a period in which the movement grew in scope, and mass socialist working-class parties in individual national states were formed. Marx&apos;s health was undermined by his strenuous work in the International and his still more strenuous theoretical occupations. He continued work on the refashioning of political economy and on the completion of Capital, for which he collected a mass of new material and studied a number of languages (Russian, for instance). However, ill-health prevented him from completing Capital. His wife died on December 2, 1881, and on March 14, 1883, Marx passed away peacefully in his armchair. He lies buried next to his wife at Highgate Cemetery in London. Of Marx&apos;s children some died in childhood in London, when the family were living in destitute circumstances. Three daughters married English and French socialists; Eleanor Aveling, Laura Lafargue and Jenny Longuet. The latter&apos;s son is a member of the French Socialist Party. The Marxist Doctrine Marxism is the system of Marx&apos;s views and teachings. Marx was the genius who continued and consummated the three main ideological currents of the 19th century, as represented by the three most advanced countries of mankind: classical German philosophy, classical English political economy, and French socialism combined with French revolutionary doctrines in general. Acknowledged even by his opponents, the remarkable consistency and integrity of Marx&apos;s views, whose totality constitutes modern materialism and modern scientific socialism, as the theory and program of the working-class movement in all the civilized countries of the world, make it incumbent on us to present a brief outline of his world-conception in general, prior to giving an exposition of the principal content of Marxism, namely, Marx&apos;s economic doctrine. Philosophical Materialism Beginning with the years 1844-45, when his views took shape, Marx was a materialist and especially a follower of Ludwig Feuerbach, whose weak point he subsequently saw only in his materialism being insufficiently consistent and comprehensive. To Marx, Feuerbach&apos;s historic and &quot;epoch-making&quot; significance lay in his having resolutely broken with Hegel&apos;s idealism and in his proclamation of materialism, which already &quot;in the 18th century, particularly French materialism, was not only a struggle against the existing political institutions and against... religion and theology, but also... against all metaphysics&quot; (in the sense of &quot;drunken speculation&quot; as distinct from &quot;sober philosophy&quot;). (The Holy Family, in Literarischer Nachlass[13]) &quot;To Hegel... ,&quot; wrote Marx, &quot;the process of thinking, which, under the name of the Idea&apos;, he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos (the creator, the maker) of the real world.... With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.&quot; (Capital, Vol. I, Afterward to the Second Edition.) In full conformity with this materialist philosophy of Marx&apos;s, and expounding it, Frederick Engels wrote in Anti-D\ufffdhring (read by Marx in the manuscript): &quot;The real unity of the world consists in its materiality, and this is proved... by a long and wearisome development of philosophy and natural science....&quot; &quot;Motion is the mode of existence of matter. Never anywhere has there been matter without motion, or motion without matter, nor can there be.... But if the... question is raised: what thought and consciousness really are, and where they come from; it becomes apparent that they are products of the human brain and that main himself is a product of Nature, which has developed in and along with its environment; hence it is self-evident that the products of the human brain, being in the last analysis also products of Nature, do not contradict the rest of Nature&apos;s interconnections but are in correspondence with them.... &quot;Hegel was an idealist, that is to say, the thoughts within his mind were to him not the more or less abstract images [Abbilder, reflections; Engels sometimes speaks of &quot;imprints&quot;] of real things and processes, but on the contrary, things and their development were to him only the images, made real, of the &quot;Idea&quot; existing somewhere or other before the world existed.&quot; In his Ludwig Feuerbachwhich expounded his own and Marx&apos;s views on Feuerbach&apos;s philosophy, and was sent to the printers after he had re-read an old manuscript Marx and himself had written in 1844-45 on Hegel, Feuerbach and the materialist conception of historyEngels wrote: &quot;The great basic question of all philosophy, especially of more recent philosophy, is the relation of thinking and being... spirit to Nature... which is primary, spirit or Nature.... The answers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primary of spirit to Nature and, therefore, in the last instance, assumed world creation in some form or other... comprised the camp of idealism. The others, who regarded Nature as primary, belonged to the various schools of materialism.&quot; Any other use of the concepts of (philosophical) idealism and materialism leads only to confusion. Marx decidedly rejected, not only idealism, which is always linked in one way or another with religion, but also the viewsespecially widespread in our dayof Hume and Kant, agnosticism, criticism, and positivism[14] in their various forms; he considered that philosophy a &quot;reactionary&quot; concession to idealism, and at best a &quot;shame-faced way of surreptitiously accepting materialism, while denying it before the world.&quot;[15] On this question, see, besides the works by Engels and Marx mentioned above, a letter Marx wrote to Engels on December 12, 1868, in which, referring to an utterance by the naturalist Thomas Huxley, which was &quot;more materialistic&quot; than usual, and to his recognition that &quot;as long as we actually observe and think, we cannot possibly get away from materialism&quot;, Marx reproached Huxley for leaving a &quot;loop hole&quot; for agnosticism, for Humism. It is particularly important to note Marx&apos;s view on the relation between freedom and necessity: &quot;Freedom is the appreciation of necessity. Necessity is blind only insofar as it is not understood.&apos;&quot; (Engels in Anti-D\ufffdhring) This means recognition of the rule of objective laws in Nature and of the dialectical transformation of necessity into freedom (in the same manner as the transformation of the uncognized but cognizable &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; into the &quot;thing-for-us&quot;, of the &quot;essence of things&quot; into &quot;phenomena&quot;). Marx and Engels considered that the &quot;old&quot; materialism, including that of Feuerbach (and still more the &quot;vulgar&quot; materialism of Buchner, Vogt and Moleschott), contained the following major shortcomings: 1) this materialism was &quot;predominantly mechanical,&quot; failing to take account of the latest developments in chemistry and biology (today it would be necessary to add: and in the electrical theory of matter); 2) the old materialism was non-historical and non-dialectical (metaphysical, in the meaning of anti-dialectical), and did not adhere consistently and comprehensively to the standpoint of development; 3) it regarded the &quot;human essence&quot; in the abstract, not as the &quot;complex of all&quot; (concretely and historically determined) &quot;social relations&quot;, and therefore merely &quot;interpreted&quot; the world, whereas it was a question of &quot;changing&quot; it, i.e., it did not understand the importance of &quot;revolutionary practical activity&quot;. Dialectics As the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development, and the richest in content, Hegelian dialectics was considered by Marx and Engels the greatest achievement of classical German philosophy. They thought that any other formulation of the principle of development, of evolution, was one-sided and poor in content, and could only distort and mutilate the actual course of development (which often proceeds by leaps, and via catastrophes and revolutions) in Nature and in society. &quot;Marx and I were pretty well the only people to rescue conscious dialectics [from the destruction of idealism, including Hegelianism] and apply it in the materialist conception of Nature.... Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern natural science that it has furnished extremely rich [this was written before the discovery of radium, electrons, the transmutation of elements, etc.!] and daily increasing materials for this test, and has thus proved that in the last analysis Nature&apos;s process is dialectical and not metaphysical. &quot; The great basic thought,&quot; Engels writes, &quot;that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a complex of processes, in which the things apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away... this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that in this generality it is now scarcely ever contradicted. But to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation are two different things.... For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy itself is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain.&quot; Thus, according to Marx, dialectics is &quot;the science of the general laws of motion, both of the external world and of human thought.&quot;[16] This revolutionary aspect of Hegel&apos;s philosophy was adopted and developed by Marx. Dialectical materialism &quot;does not need any philosophy standing above the other sciences.&quot; From previous philosophy there remains &quot;the science of thought and its lawsformal logic and dialectics.&quot; Dialectics, as understood by Marx, and also in conformity with Hegel, includes what is now called the theory of knowledge, or epistemology, studying and generalizing the original and development of knowledge, the transition from non-knowledge to knowledge. In our times, the idea of development, of evolution, has almost completely penetrated social consciousness, only in other ways, and not through Hegelian philosophy. Still, this idea, as formulated by Marx and Engels on the basis of Hegel&apos;s&apos; philosophy, is far more comprehensive and far richer in content than the current idea of evolution is. A development that repeats, as it were, stages that have already been passed, but repeats them in a different way, on a higher basis (&quot;the negation of the negation&quot;), a development, so to speak, that proceeds in spirals, not in a straight line; a development by leaps, catastrophes, and revolutions; &quot;breaks in continuity&quot;; the transformation of quantity into quality; inner impulses towards development, imparted by the contradiction and conflict of the various forces and tendencies acting on a given body, or within a given phenomenon, or within a given society; the interdependence and the closest and indissoluble connection between all aspects of any phenomenon (history constantly revealing ever new aspects), a connection that provides a uniform, and universal process of motion, one that follows definite lawsthese are some of the features of dialectics as a doctrine of development that is richer than the conventional one. (Cf. Marx&apos;s letter to Engels of January 8, 1868, in which he ridicules Stein&apos;s &quot;wooden trichotomies,&quot; which it would be absurd to confuse with materialist dialectics.) The Materialist Conception of History A realization of the inconsistency, incompleteness, and one-sidedness of the old materialism convinced Marx of the necessity of &quot;bringing the science of society... into harmony with the materialist foundation, and of reconstructing it thereupon.&quot;[17] Since materialism in general explains consciousness as the outcome of being, and not conversely, then materialism as applied to the social life of mankind has to explain social consciousness as the outcome of social being. &quot;Technology,&quot; Marx writes (Capital, Vol. I), &quot;discloses man&apos;s mode of dealing with Nature, the immediate process of production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them.&quot;[18] In the preface to his Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx gives an integral formulation of the fundamental principles of materialism as applied to human society and its history, in the following words: &quot;In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces. &quot;The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, orwhat is but a legal expression for the same thingwith the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relation turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophicin short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. &quot;Just as our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so we cannot judge of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production.... In broad outlines, Asiatic, ancient, feudal, and modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society.&quot;[19] [Cf. Marx&apos;s brief formulation in a letter to Engels dated July 7, 1866: &quot;Our theory that the organization of labor is determined by the means of production.&quot;] The discovery of the materialist conception of history, or more correctly, the consistent continuation and extension of materialism into the domain of social phenomena, removed the two chief shortcomings in earlier historical theories. In the first place, the latter at best examined only the ideological motives in the historical activities of human beings, without investigating the origins of those motives, or ascertaining the objective laws governing the development of the system of social relations, or seeing the roots of these relations in the degree of development reached by material production; in the second place, the earlier theories did not embrace the activities of the masses of the population, whereas historical materialism made it possible for the first time to study with scientific accuracy the social conditions of the life of the masses, and the changes in those conditions. At best, pre-Marxist &quot;sociology&quot; and historiography brought forth an accumulation of raw facts, collected at random, and a description of individual aspects of the historical process. By examining the totality of opposing tendencies, by reducing them to precisely definable conditions of life and production of the various classes of individual aspects of the historical process. By examining the choice of a particular &quot;dominant&quot; idea or in its interpretation, and by revealing that, without exception, all ideas and all the various tendencies stem from the condition of the material forces of production, Marxism indicated the way to an all-embracing and comprehensive study of the process of the rise, development, and decline of socio-economic systems. People make their own history but what determines the motives of people, of the mass of peoplei.e., what is the sum total of all these clashes in the mass of human societies? What are the objective conditions of production of material life that form the basis of all man&apos;s historical activity? What is the law of development of these conditions? To all these Marx drew attention and indicated the way to a scientific study of history as a single process which, with all its immense variety and contradictoriness, is governed by definite laws. The Class Struggle It is common knowledge that, in any given society, the striving of some of its members conflict with the strivings of others, that social life is full of contradictions, and that history reveals a struggle between nations and societies, as well as within nations and societies, and, besides, an alternation of periods of revolution and reaction, peace and war, stagnation and rapid progress or decline. Marxism has provided the guidance i.e., the theory of the class strugglefor the discovery of the laws governing this seeming maze and chaos. It is only a study of the sum of the strivings of all the members of a given society or group of societies that can lead to a scientific definition of the result of those strivings. Now the conflicting strivings stem from the difference in the position and mode of life of the classes into which each society is divided. &quot;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles,&quot; Marx wrote in the Communist Manifesto (with the exception of the history of the primitive community, Engels added subsequently). &quot;Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstruction of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.... The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.&quot; Ever since the Great French Revolution, European history has, in a number of countries, tellingly revealed what actually lies at the bottom of eventsthe struggle of classes. The Restoration period in France[20] already produced a number of historians (Thierry, Guizot, Mignet, and Thiers) who, in summing up what was taking place, were obliged to admit that the class struggle was taking place, were obliged to admit that the class struggle was the key to all French history. The modern periodthat of complete victory of the bourgeoisie, representative institutions, extensive (if not universal) suffrage, a cheap daily press that is widely circulated among the masses, etc., a period of powerful and every-expanding unions of workers and unions of employers, etc.has shown even more strikingly (though sometimes in a very one-sided, &quot;peaceful&quot;, and &quot;constitutional&quot; form) the class struggle as the mainspring of events.

Tei\u0161erskis himself is preparing his Dublin home for a traditional Lithuanian Christmas dinner. \u201cThis year my mother is coming to Ireland for Christmas,\u201d he says. \u201cShe wants to see her grandchildren.\u201d A traditional Christmas dinner in Lithuania consists of no less than 12 dishes or courses, all of them totally devoid of meat or milk. \u201cChristmas Eve is the last day of lent,\u201d explains Tei\u0161erskis. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to eat meat or milk products, so most of the dishes are from vegetables, fruit, mushrooms and such. Sometimes you\u2019d have fish. You don\u2019t have to eat all the food, but you have to try every dish that\u2019s on the table.\u201d A Lithuanian Christmas is never complete without one thing \u2013 traditional sugar-free biscuits covered with \u2018poppy milk\u2019. \u201cThey\u2019re called Ku iukai [Koo-choo-kai],\u201d says Tei\u0161erskis. \u201cThey\u2019re cylindrical in shape. Traditionally you\u2019d pour poppy milk over them just like you pour normal milk over cereal.\u201d Poppy milk can be produced by simply grating poppy seeds and adding some hot water. Both the seeds and the biscuits are sold in eastern European shops across Ireland. The dinner itself only starts after the first star appears in the sky, and Lithuanians do not normally clean the table after the meal. \u201cIf you clean the table after Christmas dinner you will have bad luck in the next year \u2013 that\u2019s what they say, anyway,\u201d says Tei\u0161erskis. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to leave all the food on the table until next morning and then have breakfast with the leftovers. Only then can you take the food away.\u201d Lithuanians also have many traditional divinations which are practiced on Christmas Eve. One tradition involves laying a small heap of hay on the dinner table before covering it with a tablecloth and serving the food. Then at dinner, the family members take turns to take straws from under the tablecloth \u2013 the longer the straw, the longer you will live, according to an ancient belief. Another divination involves unmarried girls going to a barn and taking as many logs as they can carry. They then bring the logs into the house and count them. If the number is even, then \u2013 as tradition has it \u2013 the girl will get married in the next year. Will Tei\u0161erskis\u2019s family practice any of these ancient Lithuanian customs? \u201cNot really,\u201d he replies. \u201cMy eldest daughter is just 12. Besides, it\u2019s hard to find logs in Dublin. Unless you\u2019re willing to use peat briquettes instead.\u201d"], "triple": ["Christmas Eve", "is the biggest holiday in", "Lithuania"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Lithuania", "subject": "XXXX-12-24"}, "_id": 24079}

Blair served in the Navy for 34 years. He was chief of U.S. Pacific Command during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and crafted what many intelligence and military officials say was an effective international counterterrorism strategy in southeast Asia, where U.S. efforts along with foreign partners are credited with diminishing terrorist groups such as Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah. Blair is also a China expert, and he was an associate director for military support at the CIA. Blair would replace Michael McConnell, who resigned the post Tuesday after nearly two years in the job.

However, by early 1838 further conflicts arose between them. In March 1838, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon moved to Far West, which had been under the presidency of Cowdery&apos;s brothers-in-law, David and John Whitmer. Smith and Rigdon took charge of the Missouri church and initiated a number of policies which Cowdery and the Whitmers felt violated the separation of church and state. On April 12, 1838, a church court excommunicated Cowdery after he failed to appear at a hearing on his membership and sent a letter resigning from the Church instead. The Whitmers, W.W. Phelps and Book of Mormon witness Hiram Page were also cut off from the church. (Far West Record, pp. 165-66). According to church records, Cowdery was cut off for inactivity, accusing Smith of adultery due to Smith&apos;s secretive practice of plural marriage, to which Cowdery was opposed and three charges of beginning law practice and seeking to collect debts after the Kirtland bank failure. Cowdery and the Whitmers became known as &quot;the dissenters,&quot; but they continued to live in and around Far West, where they owned a great deal of property. Fervent members of the Church including Sampson Avard, Lyman Wight and Hyrum Smith organized a confraternity which became known as the &quot;Danites&quot; whose first stated goal was to expel the &quot;dissenters.&quot; On June 17, 1838, President Sidney Rigdon announced to a large Mormon congregation that the dissenters were &quot;as salt that had lost its savor&quot; and that it was the duty of the faithful to cast the dissenters out &quot;to be trodden beneath the feet of men.&quot; Cowdery and the Whitmers took this Salt Sermon as a threat against their lives and fled the county. Reports of their treatment was one of the early factors which led to the Mormon War. Life apart from the Church From 18381848, Cowdery put the Latter Day Saint church behind him. He began to study law, passed the bar and began to practice law in Tiffin, Ohio. While in Tiffin, Oliver gained a reputation as an excellent lawyer, educator and political figure. In 1840, he was selected as editor of the local Democratic newspaper until it was learned that he was one of the Book of Mormon witnesses. Rather than recant his testimony, he was demoted to assistant editor. In 1846, Cowdery was nominated as his district&apos;s Democratic party candidate for the state senate. However, when his Mormon background was discovered, he was defeated. Later Latter Day Saint Contacts After Joseph Smith was assassinated, Cowdery&apos;s brother Lyman recognized James J. Strang as Smith&apos;s successor to the church presidency. In 1847, Oliver moved to Elkhorn, Wisconsin near Strang&apos;s headquarters in Voree and went into law practice with his brother. He became co-editor of the Walworth County Democrat and in 1848 he ran for state assemblyman. However, his Mormon ties were once again discovered and he was defeated. In 1848, Cowdery traveled to meet with followers of Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve who were encamped at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. On November 12, 1848, Oliver was rebaptized into the LDS church by Elder Orson Hyde of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He acknowledged the authority of the leaders of the church as presently constituted. Cowdery developed a respiratory illness and on March 3, 1850 he died in Whitmer&apos;s home in Richmond, Missouri.

He entered (1911) West Point and graduated in 1915. In 1916 he married Mamie Geneva Doud. In World War I, Eisenhower was commanding officer at Camp Colt, Gettysburg, Pa., a training camp for the new U.S. Army tank corps. After the war he was stationed (192224) in the Panama Canal Zone, was a member of the American Battle Monuments Commission, and was assistant executive (192933) in the office of the Assistant Secretary of War. From 1935 to 1940 he was in the Philippines, where he served as an aide to Douglas MacArthur. General during World War II Eisenhower&apos;s impressive performance in the 1941 army maneuvers led to his assignment in Washington, D.C. as chief of operations (1942) and preceded his meteoric rise to the top as Allied military commander of World War II. In June, 1942, General Eisenhower was named U.S. commander of the European theater of operations. He commanded U.S. forces in the North African landings (Nov., 1942) and in Feb., 1943, became chief of all Allied forces in North Africa. After successfully directing the invasions of Sicily (July, 1943) and Italy (Sept.), he was called (Dec.) to England to be supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. He was largely responsible for the cooperation between the British, American, and other forces and for the integration of land, sea, and air forces in the great battle for the European continent. His own account of the Allied defeat of Germany was published in book form as Crusade in Europe (1948). In Dec., 1944, he was made general of the army (five-star general), and in 1945 he commanded the U.S. occupation forces in Germany. In Nov., 1945, he became chief of staff of the U.S. Army and advocated the unification of the U.S. armed forces and universal military training. He resigned (Feb., 1948) as chief of staff to become (June) president of Columbia Univ. Presidency Eisenhower was sought as a nominee for presidency of the United States in 1948 but rejected the offers made him. In Dec., 1950, he obtained a leave of absence as president of Columbia to become Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR). After he negotiated basic commitments from member countries to build up the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he retired from active duty (1952) with the army to campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. With the support of Republican liberals and internationalists, he defeated his chief rival, Senator Robert A. Taft, for the nomination. His popularity as a World War II hero, and his promise to end the Korean War brought Eisenhower an easy victory over his Democratic opponent, Adlai E. Stevenson, and he took office on Jan. 20, 1953. First Term Eisenhower soon fulfilled his campaign pledge when an armistice was signed (July, 1953) in Korea after he threatened to use nuclear weapons. Eisenhower and his secretary of state John Foster Dulles continued the Truman administration policy of containing Communism and of financing the French attempt to maintain control of Indochina. Defense treaties were signed with South Korea (1953) and Taiwan (1954), and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was formed in 1954 to halt Communist expansion in Asia. After the French lost the battle of Dienbienphu and withdrew from Indochina, Eisenhower sent military aid to South Vietnam. He also tried, after the death of Soviet leader Josef Stalin in 1953, to ease cold war tensions. His &quot;atoms for peace&quot; plan and his statements at the Geneva summit conference in July, 1955, were widely heralded. At home, Eisenhower&apos;s record was less distinguished. He failed to oppose publicly Sen. Joe McCarthy. The predominance of business executives in his cabinet lent a conservative tone to his administration, while his concern for a balanced budget at a time when defense expenditures were rising rapidly, as well as his commitment to limiting the role of the government in the economy, kept Eisenhower from expanding the social welfare programs begun by his Democratic predecessors. Despite an attack of coronary thrombosis in Sept., 1955, he was reelected over Adlai Stevenson in 1956 by an even wider margin than in 1952. Second Term During his second term, desegregation became one of the primary issues on the national agenda. Although personally unenthusiastic about desegregation, he sent federal troops to Little Rock, Ark. to enforce a court-ordered school desegregation decision (Sept., 1957). His administration supported the civil-rights legislation that passed Congress (1957, 1960); and he prohibited discriminatory practices in the District of Columbia and in federal facilities such as navy yards and hospitals. International tensions increased during his second term. In 1957 he promulgated the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine, in which he proposed to send military and economic aid to any Middle Eastern nation requesting it in order to bolster that region against Communist aggression. Pursuant to that doctrine, he sent U.S. Marines to Lebanon in July, 1958. Eisenhower hosted Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev during the latter&apos;s visit to the United States in 1959. When they met at the Paris summit conference in the following year, the tone was less friendly; Khrushchev denounced Eisenhower for permitting high-altitude espionage flights over the Soviet Union and walked out of the summit. Fidel Castro&apos;s Communist regime in Cuba exacerbated cold war tensions, and In 1961, Eisenhower broke diplomatic relations with Cuba and authorized preparations for an invasion (see Bay of Pigs Invasion). Later Years In his farewell address as president, Eisenhower warned against the influence of the growing &quot;military-industrial complex.&quot; After leaving the White House, he remained generally aloof from politics, although he did occasionally comment on national issues and campaign for Republican candidates. In 1962 the Eisenhower presidential library was dedicated at Abilene, Kans.

When his mangled body was carried down from Pine Mountain, Georgia, on a litter, Private Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee noted that the bishop-general was \u2018as white as a piece of marble,\u2019 and \u2018not a drop of blood was ever seen to come out of the place through which the cannon ball had passed.\u2019 But plenty of blood had been spilled \u2014 advancing Union soldiers found the Georgia clay soaked with it the next day, along with a note reportedly staked by a ramrod into the ground nearby: \u2018You damned Yankee sons of bitches have killed our old Gen. Polk.\u2019 It was a sudden and gruesome end to a controversial military career. From the outset, Polk was vilified in Northern newspapers and in some religious circles for \u2018buckling the sword over the gown,\u2019 as he put it, and leading armed men in rebellion against their government. In contrast, other members of the American clergy either fanned or fought the flames of secession from the safety of their pulpits \u2014 or steadfastly avoided the thorny moral issues of war and slavery altogether. William H. De Lancey, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, wrote a letter to President Abraham Lincoln demanding with all the certainty and condescension of a Sunday school lesson that the church\u2019s bishops and priests be exempted from any draft. \u2018[I]t is contrary to their consciences as officers of Christ\u2019s kingdom to bear arms as soldiers and shed blood,\u2019 De Lancey said, reminding Lincoln of Christ\u2019s warning at Gethsemane: \u2018They that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\u2019 Leonidas Polk had no such qualms. He led men in battle on fields from Missouri to Georgia, a Christian soldier in a gold-buttoned gray uniform. \u2018The Lord rewards them according to their works,\u2019 he said, summing up his view of the matter in an 1863 letter to his brother. But whatever his works and his ultimate reward, Polk would indeed perish with the sword. \u2018A Man of High Social Position\u2019 Leonidas Polk was born in Raleigh, N.C., on April 10, 1806, the son and grandson of Tarheel heroes of the Revolutionary War. His father William was a member of the North Carolina General Assembly and a trustee of the University of North Carolina, and young Leonidas would enjoy all the advantages that wealth and family connections could provide. Among these was a commission to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated eighth in the class of 1827. His roommate at the academy was Albert Sidney Johnston, and he became close friends with a cadet from Mississippi two years his junior, Jefferson Davis. Another classmate, Robert E. Lee, would later write that Polk was considered by officers and cadets alike \u2018as a model for all that was soldierly, gentlemanly, and honorable.\u2019"], "triple": ["Leonidas Polk", "was born in", "Raleigh"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "subject": "Lieutenant_General"}, "_id": 63161}

Barbara Walters travels to India, Israel and throughout the United States, interviewing religious leaders, scientists, believers and non-believers alike to get a range of perspectives on heaven and the afterlife. From Valhalla to Nirvana Every culture has wrestled with the question of an afterlife, and most have come to a similar conclusion: The bad end up in Hell, the good go to Heaven. If you were a Viking who died in battle, fierce goddess warriors known as the Valkyries would carry you to Viking Heaven, Valhalla, where you would join an eternal feast.

With the publication of The Davidian Massacre and her introduction to the republication of Karl Hess&apos; Community Technology (both of which have 1995 copyrights), she is focusing on a slightly different area the importance that some of us find in a commitment to community living, and the hostility that others have to these communities. The Davidian Massacre is an eye-opening expos\u00e9 of government wrong-doing and Community Technology is a libertarian classic that has been too long out of print, but both books are important reading. Not just for libertarians, but for all those who wonder what inspires the libertarian dedication to nongovernmental solutions. Mount Carmel Center at Waco, Texas, was founded in the 1960s in a group of ramshackle houses by Ben and Lois Roden as an offshoot of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, the &quot;Branch Davidians.&quot; In 1981, 22-year-old Vernon Wayne Howell, a self-taught student of the Bible, came there seeking a prophet. He became the leading contender for the role of prophet himself after the Rodens died. His rival, George Roden, drove him out at gun point in 1984, but most of the Davidians left with him. There were years of conflict and even a gun battle between Howell and Roden, who owned Mount Carmel Center, ending in the Spring of 1988 when Howell and his Davidian followers paid 16 years of back taxes on Mount Carmel (after Roden went to jail for threatening a judge) and repossessed it under an agreement with the county that they would finally own the property if they occupied and paid taxes on it for five years. Carol Moore points out that &quot;significantly, that five-year period would end during the 1993 siege.&quot; She postulates that one of the main reasons that the Davidians were reluctant to surrender to the authorities and leave the property during the siege was a fear that by giving up occupancy they would forfeit their property to the county. In 1990, Vernon Howell legally changed his name to David Koresh. In 1991, the Davidians started tearing down separate homes at the center and building one large building where the community would live and study together. In 1992, Davidians from all over the world came to the Center to celebrate Passover Koresh&apos;s preaching centered on prophecies of the Apocalypse, and he said this might be the last Passover. The group was unconventional in other ways; beginning in 1989, Koresh had taken a number of women in the community as his wives, including some teenagers, saying that he was acting on God&apos;s command. Not everyone agreed with Koresh&apos;s leadership. Between 1990 and 1993, according to Moore, &quot;as many as twenty former members made various allegations to the government and press,&quot; including tax fraud, stashing of weapons, sexual goings on, violation of immigration laws (a number of Koresh&apos;s followers came from Australia, Canada, the Philippines, New Zealand, and England), and &quot;exposing children to explicit talk about sex and violence.&quot; Many of these charges were orchestrated by Marc Breault, a former Davidian who left the group to become a &quot;cult buster.&quot; As a result, the Center was investigated by social workers in 1992 for child abuse (the charges were dropped for lack of proof), the television program &quot;A Current Affair&quot; filmed an expos\u00e9, and various federal agencies received complaints. Perhaps because of such investigations, Koresh became convinced that the Apocalypse would begin with an attack on Mount Carmel Center. For protection, the group not only built an underground tornado shelter but reinforced the front wall of the new building with an additional two-foot high concrete wall and built a concrete room to house the Center&apos;s guns. The community ran several businesses, including a profitable legal gun business, using a licensed dealer who was not a member of the church. Among other trades, they invested in a large number of legal semi-automatic weapons, assuming that a profit could be made on their resale if the government restricted their manufacture in the future. Most of these were kept in boxes and had never been fired. This activity brought them to the attention of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) as early as July of 1992. When he was informed at that time that the BATF was questioning the gun dealer about possible illegal weapons at the Center, Koresh invited the agents to come there and inspect his weapons, an invitation that was refused. Despite its defectors, Mount Carmel Center was not falling apart as a community when agents from the BATF stormed it at the end of February 1993, supposedly to serve a warrant for David Koresh&apos;s arrest. It was a self-supporting, interracial, family community of men, women, and children united by unconventional religious and sexual ideas. It was a community that had cooperated with investigative authorities, who had not been able to find any evidence of child abuse or illegal weapons, two of the main charges later asserted in the media. And it was a community whose lives and property were then destroyed by agents of the federal government. The Davidian Massacre is an invaluable resource book, detailing day by day, sometimes minute by minute, the events that led up to the first attack by the BATF, the attack, the ensuing siege by BATF and FBI agents, the final destruction of the center by government forces using tanks aa&gt;"], "triple": ["Vernon Howell", "legally changed his name to", "David Koresh"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "David_Koresh", "subject": "David_Koresh"}, "_id": 110465}

Many corporations could expand, antitrust laws were ingnored, and he achieved disarmament with the Open Door in China. The tariff increased also. He died on August 2, 1923 of pneumonia and thrombosis while making speeches. Charles Evan Hughes 30 He was the Republican governor of New York who ran for the presidency in 1916. He lost to Wilson. He was a strong reformer who gained his national fame as an investigator of malpractices in gas and insurance companies. In 1921 he became Harding&apos;s Secretary of State. He called together the major powers to the Washington Disarmament Conference in 1921. Andrew Mellon 31 He was the Secretary of the Treasury during the 1920s and under Harding that had the theory that high taxes forced the rich to invest in tax-exempt securities rather than in factories that provided prosperous payrolls. He had followers in his theory called Mellonites. He helped engineer a series of tax reductions and reduced national debt by $10 billion. He was accused of indirectly encouraging the bull market and starting the descent into the stock market crash. Some people, however, believed he was the &quot;greatest secretary of treasury since Hamilton.&quot; He used &quot;trickle-down&quot; economics. Herbert Hoover 32 The president of the United States from 1929 to 1932 He was a republican who ran on a campaign of prohibition and prosperity.

He was convicted of leasing naval oil reserves and collecting bribes, which was called the Tea Pot Dome scandal. Harry M.

Forbes 35 In 1923 he resigned as head of the Veteran&apos;s Bureau. He swindled $200 million from the government in building Veteran&apos;s hospitals. He was sentenced to two years in the penitentiary. This was part of the Harding scandal and the &quot;Ohio gang&quot; Calvin Coolidge 36 became president when Harding died of pneumonia. He was known for practicing a rigid economy in money and words, and acquired the name &quot;Silent Cal&quot; for being so soft-spoken. He was a true republican and industrialist.

The Israeli army said its soldiers came under fire from militants hiding in the school and responded. It accused Gaza&apos;s Hamas rulers of &quot;cynically&quot; using civilians as human shields. Residents confirmed the account, saying militants were seen staging attacks from the area. Despite international criticism over civilian deaths and a diplomatic push to broker a cease-fire, Israeli said it would push on with the offensive against Hamas. Israeli ground forces edged closer to two major Gaza towns, and a total of 70 Palestinians were killed Tuesday \u2014 with just two confirmed as militants, health officials in Gaza said. A top U.N. official called for an investigation into the civilian death toll. Past Israeli ground offensives have been cut short when an errant shell or missile hit a civilian center, leading to international outcries that forced Israel to stand down. The shelling Tuesday in the northern town of Jebaliya marked the second time in hours a U.N. school came under attack; three people were killed in an attack on another U.N. school in Gaza City on Monday night. Tuesday&apos;s assault was the deadliest since Israel sent ground forces into Gaza last weekend as part of a larger offensive against Hamas that has killed more than 600 Palestinians, according to local hospital officials. Nearly half of the dead are civilians, according to U.N. and Palestinian officials. &quot;There&apos;s nowhere safe in Gaza. Everyone here is terrorized and traumatized,&quot; John Ging, the top U.N. official in Gaza, said after the Monday night attack on the compound of a U.N. school. The school has served as a shelter for refugees fleeing the 11-day offensive. A Palestinian rocket \u2014 one of two dozen fired from Gaza on Tuesday \u2014 wounded an Israeli infant. Dr. Bassam Abu Warda, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, said 36 people were killed in the Israeli strike on the U.N. school in Jebaliya. The United Nations confirmed 30 were killed and 55 injured by tank shells. In a statement, the Israeli army said an initial investigation found that &quot;mortar shells were fired from within the school at IDF soldiers. The force responded with mortars at the source of fire. The Hamas cynically uses civilians as human shields.&quot; The army said two Hamas militants \u2014 Imad Abu Askar and Hasan Abu Askar \u2014 were among the dead. Two neighborhood residents confirmed the Israeli account, saying a group of militants fired mortars from a street near the school, then fled into a crowd of people in the streets. Israel then opened fire. The residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared for their safety, said the Abu Askar brothers were known low-level Hamas militants. The attack occurred at mid-afternoon, when many people were out and about. Many people apparently stepped outside the shelter to get some air, thinking an area around a school was safe. Palestinian militants frequently fire from residential areas. However, Mohammed Nassar, a medic who treated the wounded, said he saw no gunmen among the casualties. Footage broadcast on Hamas&apos; Al Aqsa TV showed gruesome scenes at the hospital. At first, medics carried in at least five younger boys who were laid out on the hospital floor. It was not clear whether they were alive. Other medics then started unloading bodies of men who had been stacked up in the back of an ambulance, three high, and were dragged without stretchers. One man&apos;s legs had been turned into bloody stumps that dragged on the ground as he was pulled from the ambulance. The emergency room was packed, with all beds occupied and barely a patch of ground unoccupied by either a body or a doctor. In other rooms, there were bloodstains and bodies on the floor. Medics ran in to take pulses. &quot;I saw a lot of women and children wheeled in,&quot; said Fares Ghanem, another hospital official. &quot;A lot of the wounded were missing limbs and a lot of the dead were in pieces.&quot; Majed Hamdan, an AP photographer, said he rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks. At the hospital, he said, many children were among the dead. &quot;I saw women and men \u2014 parents \u2014 slapping their faces in grief, screaming, some of them collapsed to the floor. They knew their children were dead,&quot; he said. &quot;In the morgue, most of the killed appeared to be children. In the hospital, there wasn&apos;t enough space for the wounded.&quot; He said there were marks of five separate explosions, all in the area near the school. U.N. officials say they provided their location coordinates to Israel&apos;s army to ensure their buildings in Gaza are not targeted. Speaking shortly after the first attack, Maxwell Gaylard, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, demanded an investigation. &quot;As one of the most densely populated places in the world, it is clear that more civilians will be killed,&quot; he said. &quot;These tragic incidents need to be investigated, and if international humanitarian law has been contravened, those responsible must held accountable.&quot; In Britain, Prime Minister Gordon Brown called it &quot;the darkest moment yet for the Middle East.&quot; He said he had been in touch with world leaders, including from Egypt and Turkey, to discuss ways to forge a cease-fire. Israel launched its offensive on Dec. 27 to halt repeated Palestinian rocket attacks on its southern towns. After a weeklong air campaign, Israeli ground forces invaded Gaza over the weekend. Ten Israelis have died since the operation began, including a soldier who was shot on Tuesday. United Nations staff estimate around 15,000 people have fled to 23 U.N.-run schools they have turned into makeshift shelters. U.N. food aid has halted in the northern Gaza Strip because officials fear residents would risk their lives to reach distribution centers. Tanks rumbled closer to the towns of Khan Younis and Dir el Balah in south and central Gaza but were still several kilometers (miles) outside, witnesses said, adding that the sounds of fighting could be heard from around the Israeli positions. Israel has encircled Gaza City, the area&apos;s biggest city. The civilian death toll has drawn international condemnations and raised concerns of a humanitarian disaster. Many Gazans are without electricity or running water, thousands have been displaced from their homes and residents say food supplies are running thin. &quot;This is not a crisis, it&apos;s a disaster,&quot; said water utility official Munzir Shiblak. &quot;We are not even able to respond to the cry of the people.&quot; He said about 800,000 residents in Gaza City and northern parts of the territory had no access to running water from Tuesday. Gaza&apos;s overall population is 1.4 million people. Israel says it won&apos;t stop the assault until its southern towns are freed of the threat of Palestinian rocket fire and it receives international guarantees that Hamas, a militant group backed by Iran and Syria, will not restock its weapons stockpile. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he hoped to stop the offensive soon, but said it would depend on Hamas&apos; willingness to stop attacks and stop smuggling weapons into Gaza from Egypt. &quot;We have no interest in endlessly continuing the campaign. It will stop when the conditions that are essential for Israel&apos;s security are met,&quot; he said in the rocket-scarred southern Israeli town of Sderot. The army says it has dealt a harsh blow to Hamas, killing 130 militants in the past two days and greatly reducing the rocket fire. Hamas is believed to have 20,000 fighters. Israeli forces have seized the main Gaza highway in several places, cutting the strip into northern, southern and central sectors. Israel also has taken over high-rise buildings in Gaza City and destroyed dozens of smuggling tunnels \u2014 Hamas&apos; main lifeline \u2014 along the Egyptian border. A high-level European Union delegation met with President Shimon Peres on Tuesday in a futile bid to end the violence. Commissioner Benita Ferraro-Waldner acknowledged Israel&apos;s right to self-defense, but said its response was disproportionate. &quot;We have come to Israel in order to advance the initiative for a humanitarian cease-fire and I will tell you, Mr. President, that you have a serious problem with international advocacy, and that Israel&apos;s image is being destroyed,&quot; she said, according to a statement from Peres&apos; office. Israeli leaders say there is no humanitarian crisis and that they have allowed the delivery of vital supplies. French President Nicolas Sarkozy left Israel after a day of meetings with leaders. Sarkozy continued to Damascus, urging Syria on Tuesday to pressure Hamas to end the fighting. His Syrian counterpart, Bashar Assad, slammed the Israeli assault on the coastal strip as a &quot;war crime&quot; and &quot;barbaric,&quot; an &quot;aggression&quot; that Israel must halt. In Washington, the State Department said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was traveling to the United Nations Tuesday to try to broker a sustainable cease-fire. She planned meetings with Arab and European diplomats to lobby for a three-tiered U.S. truce proposal and will then attend a U.N. Security Council meeting on Gaza, spokesman Sean McCormack said. Key elements demanded by the U.S.: an end to rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza and securing border crossings between Gaza and Israel and between Gaza and Egypt. Israel&apos;s operation has angered many across the Arab world and has drawn criticism from Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, which have ties with Israel and have been involved in Mideast peacemaking."], "triple": ["Sarkozy", "continued to", "Damascus"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Damascus", "subject": "Nicolas_Sarkozy"}, "_id": 96643}

Sarkozy did not mention Hamas.", "UNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 The Security Council failed to agree on action to end the escalating crisis in Gaza on Wednesday, but the U.S. threw its weight behind a cease-fire initiative and Egypt announced it will host separate talks with Israel and Hamas on the proposal. The U.N.&apos;s most powerful body was divided because Arabs are insisting on a legally binding resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of Israeli troops while the U.S., Britain and France want a weaker statement emphasizing that a &quot;durable cease-fire&quot; requires guarantees on reopening border crossings and preventing arms smuggling to Hamas. &quot;There is no unanimity today on either of those text,&quot; France&apos;s U.N. Ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert, the current council president said after closed consultations, &quot;and because we want to go forward in a common approach we have decided to continue our talks and our negotiations.&quot; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met into the night with counterparts from key Arab and European nations over the Security Council&apos;s next step. She emerged saying: &quot;We believe that there is still work to do.&quot; That view was echoed by the Saudi and Egyptian foreign ministers. The U.S., British and French ministers, as well as the Arab negotiators, extended their stay in New York and scheduled another closed-door session Thursday morning. Rice applauded the Egyptian-French cease-fire proposal and said she had talked with both the Israelis and Arab envoys about &quot;the importance of moving that initiative forward.&quot; Israel&apos;s government said earlier that it viewed the proposal positively but stopped short of acceptance. A Hamas official said the Islamic militant group, which rules Gaza, was not ready to either accept or reject the plan, which he claimed favored Israel. Egypt&apos;s top diplomats said Wednesday that Egypt plans to broker &quot;technical&quot; talks in Cairo separately with representatives of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas on the initiative. Egypt&apos;s Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said he expected the Israeli team to arrive Thursday, but he stressed that there would be no meeting between Israel and Hamas, whose arrival date in Cairo is uncertain. Israel and the U.S. consider Hamas, which took control of Gaza in June 2007, a terrorist organization and Israel says it launched the current air and ground offensive because of persistent Hamas rocketing that has traumatized southern Israel. Aboul Gheit said Egypt will be asking Israel and Hamas for a temporary cease-fire &quot;that would lead to a consolidated permanent cease-fire.&quot; Then, he said, negotiations would take place with the European Union and the Palestinian Authority, which lost control of Gaza, on how to open the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian-Gaza border. Israel and the United States are demanding that border monitors destroy tunnels that Hamas has used to smuggle arms into Gaza from Egypt. Aboul Gheit said Egypt would next move to bring Hamas and all Palestinian organizations back to Cairo to try to get an agreement on a unity government, a coalition government, or a transition government \u2014 &quot;call it what you want.&quot; That is considered crucial to achieving the ultimate goal of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement that would see two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace. In Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the Palestinian Authority supported the cease-fire initiative, but the administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has no sway in Gaza. Sarkozy did not mention Hamas. Israeli officials were noncommittal on the plan. &quot;Israel welcomes the initiative of the French president and the Egyptian president to bring about a sustainable quiet in the south,&quot; government spokesman Mark Regev said in Jerusalem. A Hamas representative in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, said only that the group was considering the proposal, along with other ideas presented by Turkey and by Arab states. &quot;We are still studying the Egyptian proposal and I haven&apos;t said that we have rejected it. But we don&apos;t discuss the presence of monitors or international troops or forces to protect the occupation,&quot; he told Al-Arabiya television. In a potential warning sign, Hamdan complained that &quot;the initiatives mostly favor Israel.&quot; Arab ministers said one reason they are pushing for a Security Council resolution is Israel&apos;s refusal to give outright support the Egyptian-French initiative. &quot;They have been indicating willingness, or that it is a positive step, but there is not yet a clear-cut recognition and acceptance,&quot; Egypt&apos;s Aboul Gheit said. Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said the 22-nation organization didn&apos;t want &quot;a statement to express views, but a decision on a resolution that calls for a cease-fire that has the weight of the Security Council.&quot; He said the Arabs do not want to put a resolution to a vote if it will be vetoed. &quot;We&apos;ll be pushing the Arab Group to push for a vote,&quot; Aboul Gheit said. &quot;If we would manage to get the draft passed, (so) be it. If not, we will be continuing our effort on the other level.&quot; The current Libyan draft resolution would almost certainly face a U.S. veto because it doesn&apos;t address Hamas arms smuggling, and doesn&apos;t even mention Hamas by name. Moussa said the draft was being revised, including to add an endorsement of the Egyptian-French initiative. U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad urged adoption of the presidential statement, saying there was &quot;broad support&quot; for it. The draft statement stresses &quot;the urgent need for an immediate and durable cease-fire,&quot; expresses &quot;grave concern at the deepening humanitarian crisis,&quot; and says the council &quot;will take comprehensive action as Egyptian and other international initiatives will materialize.&quot; A top French diplomat in Paris said the first aim of the initiative was to speed up Israeli-Egyptian negotiations on increasing security along Gaza&apos;s borders. Then talks would be held on reopening border crossings, he said. The latter negotiations could quickly lead to an Israeli military pullout from Gaza, said the official, who was close to the initiative and agreed to describe the sensitive contacts only if not quoted by name. Under the initiative, Turkey has been asked to put together an international force for Gaza, a Mideastern diplomat said.", "In Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the Palestinian Authority supported the cease-fire initiative, but the administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has no sway in Gaza.

With the overall economy in the pits, movie moguls are just glad to have weathered the year with faithful audiences that continued to crowd into theaters. &quot;Last year was the record of all time. The economy&apos;s tough. Things are bad out there, and I think if we can have another record-breaking year or close to it, I figure we&apos;ll all be happy,&quot; said Dan Fellman, head of distribution for Warner Bros., which released the year&apos;s biggest hit with &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; ($531 million). Through New Year&apos;s Eve, 2008 domestic revenues are expected to come in just shy of 2007&apos;s record of $9.7 billion, according to box-office tracker Media By Numbers. Factoring in higher admission prices, the actual number of tickets sold in 2008 is running 5 percent behind last year&apos;s, when admissions totaled 1.4 billion. Hollywood historically survives recessions better than many businesses because movies remain relatively cheap compared with sporting events, live theater and other forms of entertainment. While consumer belt-tightening no doubt costs studios some cash, the list of 2008 blockbusters is a sign of a healthy business delivering the goods across every genre. With a $158.4 million debut, the Batman sequel &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; shattered the record for best opening weekend and has put Heath Ledger on track for a possible posthumous Academy Award as the maniacal villain the Joker. Paramount and Marvel Studios&apos; &quot;Iron Man&quot; was the superhero runner-up with a $318.3 million haul. Old-school hero Harrison Ford cracked his whip again as Paramount&apos;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; followed closely with $317 million. Among other smashes: Sony&apos;s Will Smith adventure &quot;Hancock&quot; and James Bond thriller &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;; Universal&apos;s action tale &quot;Wanted&quot;; and a rush of animated comedies led by the Disney-Pixar charmer &quot;WALL-E.&quot; While young males remained Hollywood&apos;s core audience, girls and women flocked to theaters for the Warner Bros. comedy &quot;Sex and the City&quot;; Summit Entertainment&apos;s vampire romance &quot;Twilight&quot;; Universal&apos;s musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;; and Disney&apos;s &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; concert flick. Quality-wise, the summer blockbusters came in a cut above the usual lineup of silly action and lowbrow comedy. Critics liked &quot;Iron Man&quot; and adored &quot;WALL-E&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight,&quot; the latter heading toward Jan. 22 Oscar nominations with best-picture buzz. The 2008 lineup showed that hit movies do not &quot;have to be a mindless concept,&quot; said Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount, whose 2008 successes also included the comedy &quot;Tropic Thunder,&quot; featuring fresh and wildly different performances from &quot;Iron Man&quot; star Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. &quot;If you tell a compelling story, you can get an audience to show up.&quot; With a huge Christmas weekend, Hollywood continued to serve up must-see movies, from 20th Century Fox&apos;s family tale &quot;Marley &amp; Me&quot; to a surge of awards contenders such as &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,&quot; &quot;Doubt,&quot; &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; and &quot;Gran Torino.&quot; When they see films they like, audiences tend to come back for more. So the goodwill gained from recent successes should help carry the movie business into 2009 - as long as the movies remain good, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Media By Numbers. &quot;It&apos;s vitally important now more than ever that movies deliver, because people are careful about what they&apos;re spending their money on. So they have to be satisfied with the product,&quot; Dergarabedian said. &quot;When audiences use the movies as a retreat from their everyday troubles, that retreat had better make them feel good.&quot; --- Universal Pictures is owned by NBC Universal, a unit of General Electric Co.; Sony Pictures is a unit of Sony Corp.; Paramount is a division of Viacom Inc.; Disney&apos;s parent is The Walt Disney Co.; 20th Century Fox is owned by News Corp.

During a joint press conference, Spanish President Jos\ufffd Maria Aznar thanked Bush for his administration&apos;s &quot;kindness.&quot; &quot;Spain is a friend of the United States, and President Aznar is a friend of mine,&quot; said Bush.", "By Anne Applebaum (THE WASHINGTON POST, 05/06/07): It was a sunny day in June, and George W. Bush was making a speech at the University of Warsaw. Inside, the politicians listened with interest; outside, crowds gathered to cheer; afterward, the press was full of praise. Hard to imagine, but true: That\u2019s what President Bush\u2019s first visit to Poland was like \u2014 and I was there \u2014 in the unfathomably distant summer of 2001. On that same trip, Bush also went to Spain. During a joint news conference, the Spanish prime minister, Jos\ufffd Mar\ufffda Aznar, thanked Bush for his administration\u2019s \u201ckindness.\u201d Said Bush: \u201cSpain is a friend of the United States, and [Prime Minister] Aznar is a friend of mine.\u201d Not all of that trip went so smoothly: There were protests at a U.S.-European summit and elsewhere. Nevertheless, these predictable displays of outrage were tempered by the first hints of something new: a pro-American, European alliance consisting of Tony Blair\u2019s Britain, Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Italy, the center-right governments of Spain, Portugal and Denmark, and, of course, the ex-communist states of Central Europe. These were all countries that had recently undergone market liberalization, countries prone to resent the Franco-German domination of continental politics. In 2003, when Donald Rumsfeld slightingly referred to Germany and France as \u201cOld Europe,\u201d this vague, almost-alliance acquired a name, \u201cNew Europe.\u201d It meant pro-American, accepting of global capitalism and supportive of the war on terrorism. Not coincidentally, these were the countries that eventually made up the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d in Iraq. A mere four years later, New Europe no longer exists. Aznar, Berlusconi and Blair are out of office or about to be, partly victims of failure in Iraq. Central Europe\u2019s mood has changed profoundly, from pro-American to deeply skeptical. This Friday, Bush plans to spend precisely three hours and 10 minutes on the ground in Poland, making no speeches, seeing no one much besides the Polish president. And it won\u2019t be a very wide-ranging discussion. Mortally wounded by Iraq, damaged further by the American administration\u2019s lack of interest in its concerns \u2014 change in the U.S. visa regime, military assistance \u2014 New Europe will probably now be killed off completely by American plans to build a missile defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. Belatedly, the State Department has done its best to promote the shield project, and pro-American politicians in both countries are scrambling to find a way to support it. But it remains deeply unpopular, and it isn\u2019t clear whether the parliament of either country could accept it. Europeans don\u2019t understand why a piece of equipment designed to protect the United States from Iran needs to be placed on their territory, particularly given that Iran in fact threatens Israel, not the United States or Europe. Nor do they see why they should accept without question the installation of military hardware that opens them up to new risks. This week the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, threatened to point his own nuclear missiles at Europe if the missile shield is built. \u201cIt is obvious,\u201d Putin told journalists on Sunday, that \u201cif part of the strategic nuclear potential of the U.S. is located in Europe and will be threatening us, we will have to respond.\u201d This is, of course, entirely cynical: There are good reasons to ask whether this particular system really has to be built right now, but it isn\u2019t \u201cstrategic nuclear potential,\u201d and it isn\u2019t designed to threaten Russia, as the Russians know perfectly well. Still, Putin\u2019s Cold War rhetoric is beginning to worry people all across the continent; he must be counting it a huge success. Yet it seems no one in the Pentagon ever imagined that there might be objections to the project, or that the locals might want some extra reassurance, or that a bit of judicious diplomacy might have smoothed the way in advance. According to some, the State Department didn\u2019t even know the missile shield was going ahead until the Pentagon had made the decision. Sound familiar? And all of this, every bit of it, was avoidable. Indeed, New Europe is expiring just as France and Germany have acquired leaders distinctly more pro-American than their predecessors. With a bit more attention and a bit less arrogance, the transatlantic alliance might now be reinvigorated instead of being angry and resentful.

Bush has said &quot;the time is now&quot; to grant independence to the Serbian province of Kosovo and called on Moscow not to slow down the process. &quot;I happen to believe it&apos;s important to push the process along,&quot; Bush said Sunday at a joint news conference with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha. &quot;The question is whether or not there&apos;s going to be endless dialogue on a subject that we have made up our mind about. We believe Kosovo ought to be independent.&quot; Bush is the first sitting president to visit the Balkan state that was once a closed, communist society but is now a close ally of the United States. During his seven scheduled hours in Albania, Bush was spared the sort of protests that greeted his visits to Germany and Italy. Bush enjoys widespread popularity in the country: a street in front of Albania&apos;s parliament is named after him, several postal stamps bear his image and many Albanians donned red, white, and blue hats and waved American flags during Bush&apos;s visit. Albania&apos;s government supports independence for Kosovo, a province dominated by ethnic Albanians. His visit to Tirana follows last week&apos;s Group of Eight summit in Germany, where the leaders of eight major industrialized nations discussed Kosovo among many other topics. Bush said the G8 supported Kosovo&apos;s independence, but &quot;discussions were all aimed at determining if there is a way to make this acceptable to Russia.&quot; &quot;Obviously they&apos;re not there yet ... I&apos;m worried about expectations not being met in Kosovo and therefore we&apos;ll push the process.&quot; A vote on Kosovo&apos;s independence is before the United Nations Security Council, on which Russia holds a veto-wielding seat. Bush said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would pursue the issue through diplomacy with Moscow along with America&apos;s European allies. But the diplomacy surrounding the issue seemed a bit fuzzy when Bush was asked about his call for a deadline on U.N. action on Kosovo. &quot;First of all, I don&apos;t think I called for a deadline, I thought I said (timetable),&quot; Bush said. Responding to the reporter, who could not be heard, Bush responded, &quot;I did, what exactly did I say? I said deadline? OK ... Then I meant what I said.&quot; Following his visit to Albania, Bush heads to Sofia, Bulgaria on Sunday and then returns home. &apos;Loving man&apos; Before the G8 summit, Bush visited Czech leaders in Prague then headed to Poland and Italy after the June 7-8 summit. He met Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican on Saturday, his first meeting with the pontiff who succeeded Pope John Paul II following his death two years ago. (Full story) Following his visit to Albania, Bush headed to Sofia, Bulgaria on Sunday and will return to Washington on Monday. Russia and the United States have recently been at loggerheads over Bush&apos;s plan to set up a missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland. Bush, trying to ease Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s concerns, has repeatedly said the deployment of a missile defense system would not be aimed at Russia. Bush said he was open to discussing Putin&apos;s idea of jointly setting up a system in countries more friendly to Russia, such as the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. &quot;I thought his statement was a very important statement to make. In other words, he recognized that there&apos;s an opportunity to work together,&quot; Bush said. &quot;I viewed it as a very positive gesture and looking forward to continuing discussions on this very subject in July when he comes to Maine.&quot; CNN&apos;s White House Correspondent Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report."], "triple": ["Bush", "heads to", "Sofia"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Sofia", "subject": "United_States"}, "_id": 15480}

The behind-the-scenes struggle between the two nations could explode into open warfare over a single misstep, analysts and U.S. military officials warn. Iraq has become a proxy battleground between Washington and Tehran, which is challenging \u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014 America\u2019s dominance of the Gulf. That has worried even Iraq\u2019s U.S.-backed Shiite prime minister, who \u2014 in a reflection of Iraq\u2019s complexity \u2014 also has close ties to Iran. Iran and the U.S. are already sparring on the ground. On Jan. 20, militants kidnapped and killed four American soldiers in a raid in Karbala, and a fifth American was killed in the firefight. The attack was so well planned and executed that Iraqi officials suspect Iran may have helped Shiite militiamen carry it out, perhaps in retaliation for the arrest of five Iranians by U.S. troops in northern Iraq. Those five Iranians, who were arrested in the northern city of Irbil, included two members of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard force that provides weapons, training and other support to Shiite militants in the Middle East, U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said last week. Iraqi and Iranian officials maintain the five were diplomats. Since the Karbala raid, U.S. saber-rattling has intensified. President Bush said this week that U.S. forces in Iraq would take action against Iranian operatives in the country, while insisting he had no intention of attacking Iran. \u201cIf Iran escalates its military action in Iraq to the detriment of our troops and/or innocent Iraqi people, we will respond firmly,\u201d Bush told National Public Radio. Although little evidence has been made public, U.S. officials have long insisted that Iran was supplying weapons and training to Shiite militias in Iraq, including some that have killed American troops. The No. 2 U.S. general in Iraq told USA Today in an interview published Tuesday that Iran was supplying Iraqi Shiite militias with a variety of powerful weapons, including Katyusha rockets and armor-piercing rocket-propelled grenades. \u201cWe have weapons that we know through serial numbers ... trace back to Iran,\u201d Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno said. The Air Force is considering more forceful patrols on the Iraqi side of the border with Iran to counter the smuggling of weapons and bomb supplies, The Los Angeles Times reported, citing senior Pentagon officials. The U.S. is also building up its military presence in the Gulf in what it says is a show of strength directed at Iran. A second aircraft carrier is heading for the region, and Patriot missile batteries are being deployed. Since Bush announced his new Iraq strategy in early January, Iranian officials have raised the alarm repeatedly that the U.S. intends to attack. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran is \u201cready for anything\u201d in its confrontation with the U.S. A newspaper close to Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last week threatened retaliation for any U.S. military action \u2014 including stopping oil traffic through the Gulf\u2019s strategic Hormuz Strait and attacks on U.S. interests. The top editor of the Kayhan daily warned that Iran will turn the Middle East into \u201chell\u201d for the U.S. and Israel if America attacks. Iran and the U.S. also are in dispute over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. The U.S. accuses Iran of secretly developing atomic weapons \u2014 an allegation Tehran denies. Iran\u2019s defiant refusal to suspend uranium enrichment prompted the U.N. Security Council to impose limited economic sanctions. The U.S. has also beefed up support for Lebanon\u2019s government in its power struggle with Hezbollah, the Shiite militia that Washington accuses of acting in Iran\u2019s interests. The war of words has raised fears among both Democrats and Republicans in Congress that the U.S. and Iran are drifting toward armed conflict at a time when America is struggling against determined foes in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cWhat I think many of us are concerned about is that we stumble into active hostilities with Iran without having aggressively pursued diplomatic approaches,\u201d Sen. Barack Obama said Tuesday. It has also unnerved the Iraqi government, many of whose members have close ties to Iran. \u201cWe have told the Iranians and the Americans, \u2018We know that you have a problem with each other but we\u2019re asking you, please, solve your problems outside of Iraq,\u201d\u2019 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cWe do not want the American forces to take Iraq as a base to attack Iran ... we will not accept Iran using Iraq to attack American forces. But does this exist? It exists and I assure you it exists.\u201d As the rhetoric grows more strident, a U.S. military official in the Gulf likened the U.S.-Iran standoff to the buildup in hostility in Europe before World War I, when the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne triggered a tragic war that engulfed a continent. \u201cA mistake could be made and you could end up in something that neither side ever really wanted, and suddenly it\u2019s August 1914 all over again,\u201d the U.S. officer said on condition of anonymity, because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cI really believe neither side wants a fight.\u201d Iranian coast guard vessels recently veered into territorial waters on the Arab side of the Gulf, an event that could have been viewed as either a mistake or a provocation, the officer said. Both sides are on tenterhooks. \u201cA boat crosses a line ... but what does it mean? You\u2019ve got to be very careful about overreacting,\u201d the officer said. Even if Iran pulled back from Iraq\u2019s conflict, it might not end the country\u2019s violence, said Kenneth M. Pollack, research director at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy. \u201cThe truth is that Iraq is a mess. It is in a state of low-level civil war. And all of these groups are largely self-motivated,\u201d he said on the Council on Foreign Relations Web site. \u201cBut it\u2019s much easier to blame it on the Iranians.\u201d In Tehran, political analyst Hermidas Bavand said U.S. force increases were leading many Iranians to believe Washington is looking to pick a fight. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely dangerous situation,\u201d Bavand said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Tehran wants war under any circumstances. But there might be an accidental event that could escalate into a large confrontation.\u201d"], "triple": ["Bush", "told", "National Public Radio"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "National_Public_Radio", "subject": "George_W__Bush"}, "_id": 15489}

So far this year, the Dow is down 3.5 percent.

A drop in oil added to the pessimism Monday. Crude fell 8 percent to a new low for the year as investors bet economic weakness would curb demand. Wall Street normally welcomes falling oil as a boost for consumers who pay less to put gas in their car, but steep drops can touch off deeper fears in the fragile psyche of the market: if oil falls too much it&apos;s a sign that the global economy is showing no signs of improvement. Stocks have lost ground since the Dow rose 19.6 percent from late November to the first part of 2009 -- a year-end advance often referred to as a Santa Claus rally. With so many unknowns about when the economy might recover, analysts say most investors prefer to wait until they get a better read on companies&apos; quarterly numbers and, more important, their forecasts. Wall Street is expecting fourth-quarter and full-year earnings will be particularly bleak, especially after several companies warned last week that they are being hit hard by the recession. Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc., which last week announced it would slash production, fell again Monday after an analyst lowered his rating on the stock. Alcoa said after the market closed that it lost $1.19 billion during its fourth quarter as demand for aluminum plunged. Financial stocks also declined as investors looked to Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley, which could announce a deal as soon as Wednesday to combine their brokerage operations. The potential tie-up underscores the troubles some banks are still having with tattered balance sheets, and a prominent analyst said Citigroup might still need to raise cash. Comments from President-elect Barack Obama that he would consider using some of the remaining money from the government&apos;s $700 billion bailout fund added to investors&apos; nervousness about the financial industry. &quot;I think that the biggest concern right now is the economy and whether this thing is going to get worse or it&apos;s going to get better,&quot; said Bernie McGinn, chief executive of McGinn Investment Management. The intensity of the fear that permeated the market and provoked the heavy selling of September, October and November has lessened, McGinn said, but investors are still hesitant to rush into the market. Monday&apos;s decline came on light volume, indicating an absence of buyers, not a rush of sellers. &quot;The level of anxiety and the level of fear has moderated some, but it sure as heck hasn&apos;t turned into optimism,&quot; McGinn said. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 125.21, or 1.46 percent, to 8,473.97 after being down as much as 178.

Stocks fell Friday after the Labor Department reported the nation&apos;s unemployment rate jumped to a 16-year high of 7.2 percent in December. The rise in the number of people without work has raised concerns about the health of consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation&apos;s economic activity. Bond prices were mixed Monday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 2.31 percent from 2.40 percent late Friday.

He said Monday he will fundamentally change the way the remaining $350 billion of the financial bailout fund is allocated. He said some relief would be directed toward housing and small business.

Now, Greenspan&apos;s reputation\u2026and his economy\u2026count on the recklessness continuing. Which is too bad for everybody because inflation rates are edging up. Interest rates are beginning to anticipate even higher inflation. The bond vigilantes, aslumber longer than Rip Van Winkle, now stir. Last quarter, they woke up and began to sell\u2026it was the worse for bonds in 24 years. The Fed can&apos;t take this sitting down. It has to at least appear to protest. Its honor is at stake; which is to say, it doesn&apos;t have much to lose. So it intends to raise interest rates by .25% - enough to show its heart is in the right place, but not enough to trouble anyone&apos;s wallet. If the announcement comes as expected, we will take off our reading glasses and pause for a moment of silence, here at the Daily Reckoning office in London. The present trend has lasted longer than most marriages. A person could have bought a house in 1980 and refinanced almost every year - knocking almost a full percentage point off each time. Each year, he would have had more money to spend\u2026as his mortgage payments declined. Larry Kudlow, a neo-economist, has written a remarkable article explaining why &quot;this Bush Boom is a lot like the Reagan Boom 20 Years Ago.&quot; They are similar, we reply, but only in the same way that, say, Uma Thurman, stark naked, is a lot like Dick Cheney in a negligee. Both may have a certain appeal. It depends on your tastes. In every particular - especially the essential ones - the two are quite different. Bush is not Reagan. And America 2004 is not America 1980. Back then, stocks were cheap and gold was dear. Interest rates were high and bonds were low. It was, after all, before the boom began. If anyone knows how it can be compared to the period after the boom ends he doesn&apos;t work here in the building with golden balls (explanation below). 1980, we have explained, was contrary to 2004 in almost every way. America was still the world&apos;s biggest creditor - now, it is the world&apos;s biggest debtor. America still had a positive trade balance - now it has the biggest trade negative imbalance ever achieved by any nation. Americans were still, relatively, unburdened by debt. Now, they carry such heavy loads, they may collapse at any moment. Most important, the Reagan Boom and the Clinton boom that followed were largely, if not completely, driven by falling interest rates and EZ credit. Rising rates - which is what the Fed announces today - will have the exact opposite effect. A Bush boom? Don&apos;t count on it, dear reader. [Ed. Note: Safety is underrated. So it&apos;s also cheap.

At the same time, the Arab population of Palestine was becoming strongly nationalistic and anti-European, which did not bode well for the new arrivals. At the time of WWI, Britain promised Arabs they&apos;d recognise an Arab state, and Jews they&apos;d support a Jewish homeland in Palestine. When the war ended, Britain was given a mandate to rule the country, and as Europe moved towards WWII, Britain decided to stop all migration to Israel. Desperate illegal immigrants continued to arrive, and the Arab population responded violently. By 1947 the situation had reached an impasse, Britain gave up its mandate and a resolution was passed to divide the country between Arabs and Jews. On 14 May 1948 Israel came into being. Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon invaded soon after but were defeated and when a ceasefire was declared in May 1949, Israel had extended the territory under its control in Palestine.

Every table was taken at Lundum&apos;s - a fashionable eatery with a Danish motif. Diners put down trendy portions of gravlax, beef stroganoff and other Baltic specialties, apparently unaware that their world of money shuffling from nine to five during the week, and then weekends off to Spain or Scotland was beginning to wobble. House prices are going down in London. And according to recent figures from the British Retail Consortium, shoppers are either running out of money, or having a temporary bout of sanity. Britain has always been ahead of America. The Industrial Revolution began in England before making its way over to New England. England took the lead in empire, too - extending its control over much of the world, while America still minded its own business. Unionization began in Britain, and social welfare legislation, too. We Americans have always admired the English. We lived in plain wood houses out on the prairies or backwoods; imagine how our heads turned when we saw Westminster or Buckingham Palace! We butchered savage tribes out on the frontier; imagine how we envied Wellington! We ruled from sea to shining sea; Britannia ruled the ocean waves themselves, and almost everything they touched! American statesmanship - certainly under Wilson and Roosevelt - was often nothing more than a fawning imitation of the British. Where the English went, Americans followed. And when Roosevelt went to create his New Deal, all he had to do was to look over his shoulder at his English cousins. Neville Chamberlain began picking taxpayers pockets with his &quot;Widows, Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act&quot; in 1925. A property bubble began in Britain in the late &apos;90s. America&apos;s property price bubble did not begin until five years later, but house prices on the sceptered isle have been on a gentle decline for several months. And now the threat of recession is making its way to the lips of the Dr. Mervyn King and the pages of the Daily Mail. Can the Wall Street Journal be far behind? Average house sales prices in Manhattan fell in the last quarter by 13%, explains a news item. At the top end, the decline was 36%. On the other coast, sales in San Diego fell 4%. Could this be the beginning of something big? We don&apos;t know, but we will find out. More news from The Rude Awakening\u2026 -------------- Dan Denning, reporting from Colorado: &quot;Last week, I paid a visit to Royal Dutch Shell&apos;s oil shale project in Colorado. The visit left me with more questions than answers, but I came away from the place with the sense that this opportunity is very real\u2026or, at least, it soon will be.&quot; For the rest of this story, and for more market insights, see today&apos;s issue of The Rude Awakening: Stinky Water, Sweet Oil\u2026The Final Thought -------------- Bill Bonner, back in London with more views\u2026 *** So we return to Dr. King&apos;s question: Will the next 10 years be as stable and as nice as the last 10? We have no sure answer, but we have a guess. The world advances by fits and starts; in endless cycles of growth, correction, boom, bust, innovation and destruction. One success leads not to more successes, but ultimately to more failures, since life cannot follow life. Death follows life, and then life again. One business has to go broke so that a new industry can flourish. One tree has to fall so that the small seedlings beneath it will get the sun. Everything in nature - including markets - are self-limiting, and self-correcting. Mr. Greenspan seemed to have this natural cycle in mind when he cautioned central bankers at Jackson Hole last month. The silver lining he drew out by successfully stabilizing financial markets for so long seemed to have a cloud wrapped around it. Investors, and homeowners, took stability as a fact of life, and current market conditions as permanent. Why not borrow, they said to themselves? There will always be jobs, plentiful credit at lower rates, and higher asset prices. You&apos;d have to be a fool not to buy a house on these terms. On a website this morning, we saw an advertisement: &quot;$150,000 Mortgage - Just $483 per month!&quot; A man with $1,500 of free cash flow available could borrow $450,000 - about the average cost of a house in California in 2003. A year later, he had about $100,000 in &quot;equity&quot;. What was his investment? He had to live somewhere. He had merely &quot;rented&quot; a $450,000 house for $1,500 a month. His investment was zero. Thus has the entire nation been lured into debt like a teenager into a free strip show, knowing that it can&apos;t help but be interesting. But why cannot the next 10 years be just the same? Because once the man has committed his $1,500 - he can buy no more. Sales grow sluggish. Inventories build up. Eventually, prices fall\u2026as fellows decide to take their winnings off the table. [Ed. Note: When times are easy, investors love to take risks\u2026big risks. But too many risks at once really start to add up, as we&apos;re seeing now. When something triggers a sell-off, panic rises\u2026along with lots of market volatility. But in these moments of surging volatility, certain investors can make a fortune. Find out how: The One Thing Certain to Go Up\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *** Some $88 billion of corporate debt is &quot;on the brink,&quot; says a Bloomberg report. Hertz, Clear Channel and 616 other U.S. companies are in danger of having their corporate bonds downgraded to &quot;junk&quot; status. Of course, they will be in good company. Many of America&apos;s largest and most prestigious brand names are now junk - Sears, G.M., Kodak. G.M. bonds are rated BB, meaning they are two levels below investment grade. &quot;Business bankruptcies to rise 30% in third quarter,&quot; adds a headline from the L.A. TIMES.

There&apos;s nothing like reading ideas to which you already subscribe to increase ones conviction of being right,&quot; writes one DR reader. &quot;Anyway, I thought I&apos;d send you a note to tell you about a letter I found in a magazine published during the midst of the Civil War. I recalled this because it ties in with your comments today about the glorious practice of using others to fight your battles. &quot;The letter was written by a founding member of the religious organization I belong to when that man was traveling in Virginia seeking exemptions for his brethren from military conscriptions from the Confederate Army on the grounds of conscience. &quot;Interestingly, the author (Dr. John Thomas) writes a rather scathing observation of the agents of northern U.S. towns who had been sent south to buy the freedom of black slaves in order that they could then be conscripted into the Union armies to fight against the South in place of their new white &apos;owners&apos;. Ingenious. &quot;What is rather humorous about the letter is that Dr. Thomas tells about a poor agent from a northern, more western state that was sent with only $30,000 or so and was unfortunately outbid by an agent from Boston with over $400,000, who managed to buy up all the available slaves in the area. &quot;The only improvement the current government has made to this process is that it is able to do the same without using gold, but rather paper.&quot; --- Advertisement --- &quot;How I found the World&apos;s Best Investment, in\u00a0 the Underground Vault of a Private Swiss Bank&quot; Deep beneath Bahnhofstrasse street, in the heart of Zurich&apos;s financial district, I found a way to #1--Protect your family&apos;s wealth no matter what happens in the markets #2--Make potential gains of 500% or more, with limited downside risk.

Nicholls proposed to go there with Gray in 1771, but Gray was no longer equal to the exertion, and sent off Nicholls in June. Gray was then in London, but soon returned to Cambridge, feeling very ill. He had an attack of gout in the stomach, and his condition soon became alarming. He was affectionately attended by his friend and joint executor of Gray&apos;s will, the Rev James Brown (1709-84), master of Pembroke, and his friend Stonhewer came from London to take leave of him.

Of course, Gray who had a confessed passion for French, Italian and classical culture accepted. On 29 March, 1739, they set out on the prolonged continental tour. They spent the remainder of that year in France, and crossed the Alps in November. It is typical of the scholarly bent of his mind that he studied the De Bello Gallico as he travelled through France. Livy and Silius Italicus accompanied him as he crossed the Alps later. In Paris Gray cultivated a taste for the French classical dramatists, especially Racine, whom he afterwards tried to imitate in the fragmentary tragedy in blank verse Agrippina. They also visited Versailles and the small town of Reims, before they travelled south towards Lyon and Geneva. The whole of 1740 was passed in Italy. Gray had already learned Italian and made translations from Dante, Guarini, and Tasso. Gray made a long sojourn, principally at Florence, but Rome, Naples, and Herculaneum are also described in his letters. The spring months were spent with Horace Mann, the British minister at Florence, afterwards Walpole&apos;s well-known correspondent. In Florence Gray busied himself with a long work called De principiis cogitandi, which he never finished. Gray and Walpole returned to Florence from a visit to Rome in August, and remained there until April 1741 when they set out northwards for Venice. At Reggio, however, a quarrel took place, the precise circumstances of which are unknown. Obviously, both Walpole and Gray developed in rather different directions both in their personalities and respective interests. They parted in anger and were not reconciled until 1745. Gray spent a few weeks in Venice, and from there returned home alone, visiting for the second time the monastery of the Grand Chartreuse in its sublime scenery. He left in the album of the brotherhood his Alcaic Ode, O Tu, severi religio loci. Throughout his years abroad Gray had been a careful sightseer, made notes in picture-galleries, visited churches, and brushed up his classical associations. He observed, and afterwards advised (see his letter dated &quot;Stoke, Sept. 6, 1758&quot; [letter id 321]), the judicious custom of always recording his impressions on the spot.

Orlando Bloom stars as Balian, a blacksmith who has lost his family and nearly lost his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian&apos;s father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment -- between the Second and Third Crusades -- a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias (Jeremy Irons), and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim leader Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). But Baldwin&apos;s days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin&apos;s vision of peace -- a &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot; -- is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth. Balian takes the sword and steps into history. Director: Ridley Scott.

They insist (in talking points distributed widely and dutifully reported everywhere) that the Bush administration is currently on the rocks (or, on the ropes, depending upon which metaphor you like). Their propagandists pronounce the War in Iraq is a failure and describe the War on Terrorism as one we are losing. They claim that there are hugely damaging legal problems for Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, (former) House Speaker Tom Delay, Bushs right hand man, Karl Rove, and Cheneys top guy, Scooter Libby. The Dems and the MSM tell us that there is a stench coming from Washington that exposes a culture of corruption and cronyism. (I admit that has a nice evil ring to it) They tell us Bushs domestic policy initiatives are dead. They tell us Bushs response to Hurricane Katrina was too slow and also ineffective. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina exposed the underlying racism and anti-poverty bias in the Bush administration. According to the propagandists and their willing accomplices, everyone in America is actually more vulnerable to terrorism than we were before the September 11 attacks, the economy is in the crapper (or headed there), and the GOP is coming apart at the seams. They continue to tell us Bushs is the \u201cmost divisive and secretive\u201d administration in history. Bush would not even have been President but for the inappropriate, obviously political (and legally unsupportable) 5-4 decision of the United States Supreme Court. The MSM tells us Bushs administration has declared war on science, hates poor people, and is captive (at times) to Big Business, polluters, wealthy taxpayers, and the religious right. According to most American (and foreign) media, The Patriot Act is the most invasive corrosion on personal civil liberties in history, Republican leaders are hypocrites, and Bush alternates between being a hollow puppet, and at other times, a devoutly religious but stubborn simpleton incapable of complex thought and immovable on issues of import. According to these clowns, Bushs many shortcomings and multiple troubles are evident in his low approval ratings, the many public defections from leaders in his own party, and the poor reception of his latest Supreme Court nominee, Harriet Miers, and projections that the Democrats are poised to potentially make huge gains in coming elections. FOLKS, these fools are wrong. The Democrat party leadership is wrong. The Main Stream Media is wrong. In fact, here is something you may have forgotten. The Democrats and the Main Stream Media are (almost) always wrong! Want some examples? I could do one or two or three for each item listed above, but let me present some basic but illustrative proof. Barely three months ago, when the President tapped John Roberts to serve on the US Supreme Court, the uproar from the WRONG ones was loud and constant. Roberts was an extreme zealot, selected by Bush as a payback to the Religious Right, and destined to bitterly divide the US Senate. Editorials and columns published in the days after Roberts was first nominated said Roberts was picked not because of his qualification, but because of his lack of paper trail. His confirmation was likely to cause a party-line Senate vote, and would surely serve to further divide the already highly partisan American populace. What actually happened? The most secretive and most divisive administration in history promptly turned over more papers from Roberts work for the Federal Government than had ever been turned over for any judge in the history of the Republic. During his televised Senate Confirmation hearings, Roberts impressed nearly everyone as a brilliant scholar exceptionally well versed in the history of the US Supreme Court, the role of the Court, and every conceivable aspect of Constitutional law. Americans who watched the hearing favored (by a 4 to one margin) Roberts ascension to the Court. His confirmation in the US Senate garnered more votes than had been gathered by any nominee to the position of Chief Justice in American history! The hardcore Kool Aid peddlers on the left, even in the face of all these successes that proved them wrong, still insisted that Roberts had failed to live up to the Ginsburg Rule during his Senate hearings. That notion was finally and completely exposed as false when Justice Ginsburg herself said that Roberts had behaved exactly as he should have, according to her own rule. How many columnists, analysts and editorial boards admitted they were wrong about Roberts? If you said none, go to the head of the class. For months we have been hearing that the efforts by the Iraqi people to carve a new government out of the graveyard of tyranny have been failing; the attempt to aid the Iraqis in defending their own people have been floundering; Al-Queda and the insurgents are winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people; and, the infrastructure in Iraq is worse off now than it was under Saddam. For most of 2004, we heard that the Iraqi people wouldnt be able to hold an election in January 2005, and, if they did, there would not be widespread participation. When that widespread liberal prediction was proven wrong, they switched to entirely new lines of attack. For the last several months, we have heard that the Draft Constitution wouldnt get done, and the election regarding its approval would not proceed on time. What has actually happened in Iraq? The abilities of Iraqi military and police forces to defend Iraqis have progressed more rapidly than imagined. Despite specific efforts by the terrorist-led insurgents to try to discourage people from joining the defense and law enforcement branches, tens of thousands of Iraqis have signed up, been trained, and developed sufficient competence that overwhelming majorities of the country are defended by Iraqi forces. For every American who has died in Iraq, more than 10 insurgents, Saddam loyalists or foreign terrorists have been eliminated. More Iraqis have consistent reliable utility service today than at any point in Iraq history. This past weekends national election on the Draft Constitution had an extremely high participation rate (higher even than the turnout in the last US Presidential election). The conversion from tyranny to Democracy in Iraq is proceeding more quickly than any other in Human history. Al-Queda is on the ropes, financially, and their public support in Iraq is diving rapidly. How many columnists, analysts and editorial boards admitted they were wrong about Iraq? If you said zero, write yourself a pass to get out of class! I could go on, but I am almost out of time. I shall offer the following in summary form, and will, perhaps, add more details in subsequent entries. My main thrust is: the Democrat Party and the Main Stream Media are completely wrong. (and will continue to be) You believe them at your own peril. Senator Frist, Congressman Delay, Karl Rove and Scooter Libby will walk with very little penalty(because they broke no laws). Harriet Miers will be withdrawn by Bush, or, if kept in the mix, easily confirmed. Once withdrawn (very likely, because the whole thing is a play), she will be replaced by a rock-solid conservative jurist who will be confirmed by the full Senate. Bushs domestic agenda will thrive. The tax rate reductions will be made permanent, the marriage penalty will go away, the Death Tax will disappear. We will develop and implement a national energy policy involving reductions in our dependence upon foreign oil. Social Security will be modified. The Department of Defense will be reworked. Success in Iraq and Afghanistan will continue at a remarkable rate. Conditions in Syria, Pakistan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, North Korea, China, Africa, Iran, Palestine and Israel will continue to improve, with the largest troublespot being free elections in Palestine this January. It will be wierd if Hammas gains many seats in the new government. We will win the War on Terror against stateless terrorism networks devoted to radical religious themes. The Republican Party will increase its margins in the US Senate and House, and in state legislatures, and in Governorships and Mayorships for the remainder of Bushs term. The emerging election trend (which will continue) will be the erosion of several of the various sub-constituencies in the Democrat party.

This basically means that the Tolkien Trust&apos;s attempt to block production of The Hobbit film will not be allowed to happen. So while New Line Cinema (and parent company Warner Brothers) may still be on the hook for the full amount of the Tolkien Trust&apos;s lawsuit ($150 million) in compensatory damages, the Tolkien Trust will not be allowed to block production of a Hobbit movie. 8/22/08 It has been announced that the screenplay for The Hobbit movie will be co-written by Producer Peter Jackson, Director Guillermo del Toro, and Lord of the Rings script co-writers Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens. This does not come as a surprise. Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens co-wrote the award-winning Lord of the Rings movie script, and del Toro has a history of writing his own scripts. 7/3/08 Guillermo del Toro spoke of The Hobbit movie recently at the Los Angeles film festival before the premier of his film Hellboy II and had some very interesting things to say. Del Toro signed on back in April to direct two films, The Hobbit and a &quot;bridge&quot; between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings with Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson as Executive Producer. In the recent interview with Sci Fi Wire del Toro hints that a second Hobbit movie may not be in the cards. Most original reports were that both Hobbit movies would be shot back to back, as the Lord of the Rings films were. Del Toro dismissed the idea, and expressed some doubt about a second movie. &quot;We believe there is a second movie,&quot; del Toro said. The copyright owned by the studio covers only The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, so any bridge story created would need to come from those source texts and their &quot;appendices&quot;. Writings published later in Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle-earth would be off the table and the material therein unusable. Del Toro adds: &quot;If there isn&apos;t, there will not be. If we find it, we will shoot it, but by God, if we do not find it, we will not shoot it. I am anxious to shoot the book, and I&apos;m willing and able to dedicate myself to shooting [the second film]. It is too early right now to say.&quot; In other news, names have been been bandied about concerning casting. Ian McKellen will be back as Gandalf, but the other roles remain wide open. One name that has been tossed out frequently for the main role of Bilbo Baggins is James McAvoy, but all involved deny that any negotiations have begun or decisions made.

His parents, Denis and Margery, soon moved with Ian and his sister Jean to the coal mining town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian would ride out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theater, which was encouraged by his parents. They would all bring him to plays, those by William Shakespeare in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian&apos;s growing passion for theatre. When Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in Twelfth Night. Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theater festivals, where he saw the greats perform: Olivier, Hiller, Gielgud,Richardson and Robeson. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest. McKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian&apos;s homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing Margaret Thatcher&apos;s &quot;section 28&quot; legislation which would make the &quot;public promotion of homosexuality&quot; a crime. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand, and he has been active in the Gay Rights movement ever since. Ian currently resides in Limehouse, where he lives with his current lover of 8 years, Sean Mathias. The two worked together on the film Bent. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theater, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare&apos;s works including His well recieved &quot;Richard III&quot;, and in a variety of other movies. However it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films,&quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; and &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot;, riveted audiences. The latter in particular created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen&apos;s role garnered him several of awards and nominations,including a Golden Globe and an Oscar Nod. McKellen Continues to work extensively on stage...solidifying his role as Laurence Olivier&apos;s worthy successor,having recently scored hits in the London productions of Peter Pan and Noel Coward&apos;s &quot;Present Laugher&quot;."], "triple": ["Ian", "currently resides in", "Limehouse"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Limehouse", "subject": "Ian Murray McKellen"}, "_id": 49150}

Buddhism unlike Hinduism had a specific founder. Buddhism has as its beginning round 500 bc. The founder or Buddha was Siddhartha Guatama. Guatama was born into a wealthy family in India. His father was a King in northern east India. One day a priest prophicied over Siddhartha that he could be a great savior to the world if he left the palace. But if he remained in the palace he would only be a great king. This troubled his father who saw that his son would think of greater things by leaving the palace and ultimately giving away his kingly succession to the throne. Impressed by the priests prophecy Siddhartha left the palace to embark on a journey of &apos;enlightenment&apos; (McDowell,1992: 304-305). On his journey he saw &quot;four passing sites.&quot; He came across a feeble man, a sick man, a funeral procession and finally a man who begged for food on the street. He went back to the palace to leave for his journey of enlightenment. On his journey he was meditating under a fig tree. While meditating he reached what Buddhist call Nirvana. Nirvana is the highest state of consciousness. McDowell calls it &quot;God-consciousness.&quot; At this point he was no longer called Siddhartha but the Buddha, the enlightened One. After his vision he gathered five monks who had been with him on his journey and taught them what he had learned from his enlightened experience. He taught them that there were two extremes that should not be practiced in life. The first extreme is a life of wealth and self gain. He told them to forswear wealth, the riches of the material world, because these would only lead to pain. The other extreme that Buddha told his monks to avoid was one that was &quot;conjoined with self-torture, which is painful, ignoble, and useless.&quot; &gt;From these two extremes Buddha was teaching a life of simplicity. Buddha told the monks that there is a middle path. The middle path included eight ways or teachings; &quot;right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.&quot; Buddha also told them that pain or &quot;dukkha&quot; is a noble truth. The noble truth of pain is; &quot;birth is painful, old age is painful, sickness is painful, death is painful, sorrow, lamentation, dejection, and despair are all painful.&quot; Buddha also taught them that the noble truth of pain is &quot;the craving, which tends to rebirth, combined with pleasure and lust, finding pleasure here and there, namely the craving for passion, the craving for existence, the craving for non-existence.&quot; Buddha then told them that the goal in life was to live without pain. He said that &quot;the noble truth of the path that leads to the cessation of pain, the cessation without a remainder of craving, the abandonment, forsaking, release, non-attachment.&quot; By the end of his death at age 80, Buddha had spread his teaching throughout India (McDowell 306.) This truth is the key teaching of Buddhism. The idea is that man to gain true enlightenment must gain nothing that is not key to sustaining him. Simplicity for lack of a better western term would fit here (McDowell,1992: 305-307). In Theravada Buddhism says that the image or reality of the self is a source of &quot;bondage&quot; Gotama Buddha through an enlightenment experience made his self a &quot;gone-out no self&quot; He had reached nibbana. This meant that he had become or gained complete control of his lifein terms of responsiveness to others, the penetrating perception of their natures, his won expanded mental and spiritual powers, and total inward control, Gotama had become a type of &apos;superperson&apos; Also in Theravada Buddhism the belief in the self or idea of a fixed self can lead not only to bondage and suffering, but the idea of the self can lead to being reborn into the same bondage and pain. (Ingrham 166.) According to Access to Insight; Readings in Theravada Buddhism, Buddha when presented with the question about the existence or non-existence of the self, Buddha responded that it was a question best left alone. Left alone not for another revelation in time or rumination of enlightenment, but to hold to the question about a self or no-self, would ultimately lead to a stressful life of unease and unrest. In this sense, the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self, but a not-self strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause, leading to the highest, undying happiness (Bhikkhu.) Described in the Mahayana view of self-hood &quot;Fatsang&apos;s Hall of Mirrors.&quot; &quot;In the ceiling and floor, on all four walls, and even in the four corners of the room were fixed huge mirrors- all facing one another.&quot; This view of Buddhist self-hood places the Buddhist likeness or image in the middle. &quot;In each and every reflection of any [one] mirror you will find all the reflections of all the other mirrors, together with the specific Buddha image in each, without omission or misplacement&quot;(Ingram.158) In other words no self fixed can be found in the middle, only the reflection of the surrounding universe. &quot;All is Mind&quot; and this mind is but a nexus, a center point with out affixation. This I found to be one of the most explanatory examples of what Buddhists believe about the self. The idea is that which is giving the reflection and that which is receiving the reflection merges into one entity. This fusion is described in the phrase, &quot;all is Mind.&quot; The idea is that &quot;no self or entity has any self-inclosed, independent reality of its own&quot;(Ingram, 1986: 158). But what about the body? If we don&apos;t have a self then what about all of our emotions? What&apos;s to be said about the empirical reality? Buddha offers that we are five skandhas. Skandha roughly translated means &quot;heap, aggregate, or component of individuality.&quot; In other words we are as a being made up of five different components. The Five Skandhas are; &quot;First, form: Solidity, earth element, shape. Second, feelings: Sensations. Not just emotional feelings, but also physical sensations and so on. Whatever we feel. The third skandha is perceptions: Experiences, like thoughts, sights, sounds, and so on. In the second and third skandhas, in feelings and perceptions, liking and not liking arise. That&apos;s when the whole problem, the whole duality, the whole push and shove starts. The entire, exhausting treadmill or roller coaster of ups and downs. The fourth is will or volition: Intending to do things. That&apos;s where karma comes in. Liking and not liking arise, then from that devolves reactions. Reactions rather than freedom and proactivity. Our form feels things, perceives things this way or that way, liking or not liking. Then actions or intentions push or pull, trying to get more, get less, ignore it, or get away from it. Avoidance, denial, greed, demandingness, attachment, and so on, equals dissatisfaction and misery. And fifth is consciousness, or as Buddhism says, consciousness: States of mind&quot; (www.dzogchen.org.)"], "triple": ["Buddhism", "was born out of", "Hinduism"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Hinduism", "subject": "Buddhism"}, "_id": 16215}

After 6 years of struggle, he then renounced asceticism, ate and drank, and then sat underneath the Bodhi tree, vowing to remain there until he understood how to escape from the cycle of rebirth.

Hence he was called the Buddha, &quot;The Enlightened One&quot;. He then spent the following 45 years preaching his ideas, setting up monasteries, and ordaining disciples. In the centuries after his death (called the parinirvana, as he entered that blissful and unexplainable state called Nirvana rather than being reborn), Buddhism spread throughout India, Southeast Asia and China. During this time it underwent many transformations, one of which was to divide into a number of different sects, based on different ideas of what the Buddha had actually meant in many of his pronouncements and on how to actually implement his ideas.

For a practising Buddhist it consists of maintaining the five Buddhist Precepts, which are to refrain from: 1.Deliberately causing the death of any living being; 2.Intentionally taking for one&apos;s own the property of another; 3.Sexual misconduct, in particular adultery; 4.Lying and breaking promises; 5.Drinking alcohol or taking stupefying drugs which lead to lack of mindfulness. Right Effort, Mindfulness and Concentration refer to the practice of Meditation, which purifies the mind through the experience of blissful states of inner stillness and empowers the mind to penetrate the meaning of life through profound moments of insight. Right Understanding and Thought are the manifestation of Buddha-Wisdom which ends all suffering, transforms the personality and produces unshakeable serenity and tireless compassion. According to the Buddha, without perfecting the practice of Virtue it is impossible to perfect Meditation, and without perfecting Meditation it is impossible to arrive at Enlightenment Wisdom. Thus the Buddhist Path is a Gradual Path, a Middle Way consisting of Virtue, Meditation and Wisdom as explained in the Noble Eightfold Path leading to happiness and liberation. 4. Kamma Kamma means &apos;action&apos;. The Law of Kamma means that there are inescapable results of our actions. There are deeds of body, speech or mind that lead to others&apos; harm, one&apos;s own harm, or to the harm of both. Such deeds are called bad (or &apos;unwholesome&apos;) kamma. They are usually motivated by greed, hatred or delusion. Because they bring painful results, they should not be done. There are also deeds of body, speech or mind that lead to others&apos; well being, one&apos;s own well being, or to the well being of both. Such deeds are called good (or &apos;wholesome&apos;) kamma. They are usually motivated by generosity, compassion or wisdom. Because they bring happy results, they should be done as often as possible. Thus much of what one experiences is the result of one&apos;s own previous kamma. When misfortune occurs, instead of blaming someone else, one can look for any fault in one&apos;s own past conduct. If a fault is found, the experience of its consequences will make one more careful in the future. When happiness occurs, instead of taking it for granted, one can look to see if it is the result of good kamma. If so, the experience of its pleasant results will encourage more good kamma in the future. The Buddha pointed out that no being whatsoever, divine or otherwise, has any power to stop the consequences of good and bad kamma. The fact that one reaps just what one sows gives to the Buddhist a greater incentive to avoid all forms of bad kamma while doing as much good kamma as possible. Though one cannot escape the results of bad kamma, one can lessen their effect. A spoon of salt mixed in a glass of pure water makes the whole very salty, whereas the same spoon of salt mixed in a freshwater lake hardly changes the taste of the water. Similarly, the result of a bad kamma in a person habitually doing only a small amount of good kamma is painful indeed, whereas the result of the same bad kamma in a person habitually doing a great deal of good kamma is only mildly felt. This natural Law of Kamma becomes the force behind, and reason for, the practice of morality and compassion in our society. 5. Rebirth The Buddha remembered clearly many of His past lives. Even today, many Buddhist monks, nuns and others also remember their past lives. Such a strong memory is a result of deep meditation. For those who remember their past life, Rebirth is an established fact which puts this life in a meaningful perspective. The Law of Kamma can only be understood in the framework of many lifetimes, because it sometimes takes this long for Kamma to bear its fruit. Thus Kamma and Rebirth offer a plausible explanation to the obvious inequalities of birth; why some are born into great wealth whereas others are born into pathetic poverty; why some children enter this world healthy and full-limbed whereas others enter deformed and diseased... The fruits of bad Kamma are not regarded as a punishment for evil deeds but as lessons from which to learn, for example, how much better to learn about the need for generosity than to be reborn among the poor! Rebirth takes place not only within this human realm. The Buddha pointed out that the realm of human beings is but one among many. There are many separate heavenly realms and grim lower realms, too, realms of the animals and realms of the ghosts. Not only can human beings go to any of these realms in the next life, but we can come from any of these realms into our present life. This explains a common objection against Rebirth that argues &quot;How can there be Rebirth when there are ten times as many people alive today than there were 50 years ago?&quot; The answer is that people alive today have come from many different realms. Understanding that we can come and go between these different realms, gives us more respect and compassion for the beings in these realms. It is unlikely, for example, that one would exploit animals when one has seen the link of Rebirth that connects them with us. 6. No Creator God The Buddha pointed out that no God or priest nor any other kind of being has the power to interfere in the working out of someone else&apos;s Kamma. Buddhism, therefore, teaches the individual to take full responsibility for themselves. For example, if you want to be wealthy then be trustworthy, diligent and frugal, or if you want to live in a heaven realm then always be kind to others. There is no God to ask favours from, or to put it another way there is no corruption possible in the workings of Kamma. Do Buddhists believe that a Supreme Being created the universe? Buddhists would first ask which universe do you mean? This present universe, from the moment of the &apos;big bang&apos; up to now, is but one among countless millions in Buddhist cosmology. The Buddha gave an estimate of the age of a single universe-cycle of around 37,000 million years, which is quite plausible when compared to modern astrophysics. After one universe- cycle ends another begins, again and again, according to impersonal law. A Creator God is redundant in this scheme. No being is a Supreme Saviour, according to the Buddha, because whether God, human, animal or whatever, all are subject to the Law of Kamma. Even the Buddha had no power to save. He could only point out the Truth so that the wise could see it for themselves. Everyone must take responsibility for their own future well-being, and it is dangerous to give that responsibility to another. 7. The Illusion of Soul The Buddha taught that there is no soul, no essential and permanent core to a living being. Instead, that which we call a &apos;living being&apos;, human or other, can be seen to be but a temporary coming together of many activities and parts - when complete it is called a &apos;living being&apos;, but after the parts separate and the activities cease it is not called a &apos;living being&apos; anymore. Like an advanced computer assembled of many parts and activities, only when it is complete and performs coherent tasks is it called a &apos;computer&apos;, but after the parts are disconnected and the activities cease it is no longer called a &apos;computer&apos;. No essential permanent core can be found which we can truly call &apos;the computer&apos;, just so, no essential permanent core can be found which we can call &apos;the soul&apos;. Yet Rebirth still occurs without a soul. Consider this simile: on a Buddhist shrine one candle, burnt low, is about to expire. A monk takes a new candle and lights it from the old. The old candle dies, the new candle burns bright. What went across from the old candle to the new? There was a causal link but no thing went across! In the same way, there was a causal link between your previous life and your present life, but no soul has gone across. Indeed, the illusion of a soul is said by the Buddha to be the root cause of all human suffering. The illusion of &apos;soul&apos; manifests as the &apos;Ego&apos;. The natural unstoppable function of the Ego is to control. Big Egos want to control the world, average Egos try to control their immediate surroundings of home, family and workplace, and almost all Egos strive to control what they take to be their own body and mind. Such control manifests as desire and aversion, it results in a lack of both inner peace and outer harmony. It is this Ego that seeks to acquire possessions, manipulate others and exploit the environment. Its aim is its own happiness but it invariably produces suffering. It craves for satisfaction but it experiences discontent. Such deep- rooted suffering cannot come to an end until one sees, through deep and powerful meditation, that the idea &apos;me and mine&apos; is no more than a mirage. These seven topics are a sample of what the Buddha taught. Now, to complete this brief sketch of Buddhism, let&apos;s look at how these Teachings are practised today. Types of Buddhism One could say that there is only one type of Buddhism and that is the huge collection of Teachings that were spoken by the Buddha. The original Teachings are found in the &apos;Pali Canon&apos;, the ancient scripture of Theravada Buddhism, which is widely accepted as the oldest reliable record of the Buddha&apos;s words. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos. Between 100 to 200 years after the passing away of the Buddha, the Sangha (the monastic community) split over the political question of &apos;Who runs the Sangha?&apos; A controversy over some monastic rules was decided by a committee of Arahats (fully Enlightened monks or nuns) against the views of the majority of monks. The disgruntled majority resented what they saw as the excessive influence of the small number of Arahats in monastery affairs. From then on, over a period of several decades, the disaffected majority partially succeeded in lowering the exalted status of the Arahat and raising in its place the ideal of the Bodhisattva (an unenlightened being training to be a Buddha). Previously unknown scriptures, supposedly spoken by the Buddha and hidden in the dragon world, then appeared giving a philosophical justification for the superiority of the Bodhisattva over the allegedly &apos;selfish&apos; Arahat. This group of monks and nuns were first known as the &apos;Maha Sangha&apos;, meaning &apos;the great (part) of the monastic community&apos;. Later, after impressive development, they called themselves the &apos;Mahayana&apos;, the &apos;Greater Vehicle&apos; while quite disparagingly calling the older Theravada &apos;Hinayana&apos;, the &apos;Inferior Vehicle&apos;. Mahayana still retains most of the original teachings of the Buddha (in the Chinese scriptures these are known as the &apos;Agama&apos; and in the Tibetan version as the &apos;Kangyur&apos;) but these core teachings were mostly overwhelmed by layers of expansive interpretations and wholly new ideas. The Mahayana of China, still vibrant in Taiwan, reflects an earlier phase of this development, the Mahayana of Vietnam, Korea and Japan (mostly Zen) is a later development, and the Mahayana of Tibet and Mongolia is a much later development still. Buddhism&apos;s relevance to the world today Today, Buddhism continues to gain ever wider acceptance in many lands far beyond its original home. Here in Australia, many Australians through their own careful choice are adopting Buddhism&apos;s peaceful, compassionate and responsible ways. The Buddhist Teaching of the Law of Kamma offers our society a just and incorruptible foundation and reason for the practice of a moral life. It is easy to see how a wider embracing of the Law of Kamma would lead any country towards a stronger, more caring and virtuous society. The Teaching of Rebirth places this present short lifetime of ours in a broader perspective, giving more meaning to the vital events of birth and death. The understanding of Rebirth removes so much of the tragedy and grief surrounding death and turns one&apos;s attention to the quality of a lifetime, rather than its mere length. From the very beginning, the practice of meditation has been at the very heart of the Buddhist Way. Today, meditation grows increasingly popular as the proven benefits to both mental and physical well being become more widely known. When stress is shown to be such a major cause of human suffering, the quieting practice of meditation becomes ever more valued. Today&apos;s world is too small and vulnerable to live angry and alone, thus the need for tolerance, love and compassion is so very important. These qualities of mind, essential for happiness are formally developed in Buddhist meditation and then diligently put into practice in everyday life. Forgiveness and gentle tolerance, harmlessness and peaceful compassion are well known trademarks of Buddhism, they are given freely and broadly to all kinds of beings, including animals of course, and also, most importantly, to oneself. There is no place for dwelling in guilt or self-hatred in Buddhism, not even a place for feeling guilty about feeling guilty! Teachings and practices such as these are what bring about qualities of gentle kindness and unshakeable serenity, identified with the Buddhist religion for 25 centuries and sorely needed in today&apos;s world. In all its long history, no war has ever been fought in the name of Buddhism. It is this peace and this tolerance, growing out of a profound yet reasonable philosophy, which makes Buddhism so vitally relevant to today&apos;s world. Are rebirth and karma for real? Is rebirth for real - either as a human or in one of the other realms? This is the question most Westerners ask as soon as they become interested in Buddhism. Karma (Pali: Kamma) - the law of cause and effect - operates across multiple lifetimes, but where&apos;s the proof that there is any life other than the current one? It&apos;s a complex subject and each tradition has its own explanation. It isn&apos;t uncommon for different teachers in the same tradition to have a different take on rebirth. One thing&apos;s for sure, there is no scientific proof of rebirth (yet). There are rational explanations, but they all rest on unprovable assumptions. One way to approach the question of rebirth is suggested by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, who says, &quot;You don&apos;t have to believe in rebirth, you just have to take it as a working hypothesis.&quot; Other teachers, such as Ajahn Summedho, have a similar view, that since we can never know what will happen after death, it makes sense to practise Dharma (Pali: Dhamma) and live this life in the best way possible. Some well-known monks, Ajahn Brahm and P.A. Payutto among them, say that when meditators reach the third or fourth jhana (level of absorbtion) they are able to &quot;read their past lives&quot; as the Buddha did and experience the truth of rebirth. But this ability is by no means universal, even among meditation masters. Another explanation championed by Buddhadasa, Thailand&apos;s most revered monk, is that rebirth in a series of physical bodies is &quot;conventional talk&quot; to make the subject understandable for the masses, but in &quot;Dharma talk&quot; what the Buddha really meant was that each life was the arising of the ego in the mind. So we experience &quot;death&quot; and &quot;rebirth&quot; (of the ego) many times each day. Similarly, the six realms of existence all correspond to states of mind. In the same way, the cause and effect of karma can be observed in our own mental states - when we do good deeds it results in a wholesome mental state, when we do bad deeds, we experience unwholesome mental states. This rational explanation of rebirth and karma doesn&apos;t necessarily exclude the traditional view. It augments it. What works for me is to take both of them as working hypotheses and practise accordingly. Recalling the Buddha&apos;s story about the man shot with a poisoned arrow, if we need to have every detail of the teaching proved to us at the outset, we&apos;ll be dead before we start practising. What is our purpose in life? The traditional answer to this is that our purpose is to attain nirvana and stop the endless cycle of rebirths and suffering. But the idea of a general purpose for mankind suggests that someone or something created that purpose, which in turn suggests an omnipotent deity. The way I think of it is that we have no pre-ordained purpose. We evolved, and here we are. Because we also evolved language and conceptual thinking, we got stuck with this concept of a self, an ego that makes us feel separate from everything else. The ego needs constant reassurance of its importance, which is why we cling to our views and defend them fanatically, and why we are constantly criticizing others. Our ego rules our lives. It is terrified of being snuffed out. We handle this in different ways. Some of us have lots of kids so we can feel that a part of us lives on forever through our descendants. Some of us perform heroic deeds so that our names will live on in history forever. Some of us get onto Ripley&apos;s Believe It Or Not with the world&apos;s longest moustache or beating the world record for smashing melons with our head, or some such nonsense, so that we&apos;ll achieve digital immortality. Some of us cling to the idea that a god will give us eternal life in some form after death. For those of us who don&apos;t find this pseudo-immortality or unguaranteed immortality satisfying, there&apos;s a need to create our own purpose in life. This is where Buddhism fits the bill nicely. Instead of being ruled by the ego and its fears, get rid of it! Being rid of the ego and the suffering it brings is what Ajahn Jagaro called &quot;True Freedom&quot; - a very appealing idea for all of us. If we don&apos;t achieve true freedom in this life, we should get another chance in a future life. But simply diminishing the ego and increasing freedom in this life seems like a worthwhile purpose to me. What&apos;s the difference between Theravada and Mahayana? To preserve the monastic order, the Buddha set down 227 rules for a bhikkhu (monk) to observe and 311 for a bhikkhuni (nun). Before his death (known as parinirvana) he said that some minor rules could be changed. Within a short time of his passing away there was disagreement over what could be changed and different sects emerged. The more reformist sects later called themselves Mahayana (greater vehicle) and referred to the conservative sects as Hinayana (lesser vehicle). The only conservative sect remaining today is Theravada, which is prevalent in Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. Theravada recognises the Pali Canon as its scriptures and a variety of ancient Theravadin commentaries. Whereas Theravada spread to the south and east, Mahayana moved to the northwest through what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan and then across Central Asia to China, Tibet, Vietnam, Korea and Japan. For historical reasons, the language of Mahayana scriptures was Sanskrit and that of Theravada was Pali. Hence the difference in spelling of some common Buddhist terms: Nirvana/Nibbana, Sutra/Sutta, Karma/Kamma, Dharma/Damma, etc. Westerners are more familiar with Mahayana Sanskrit terms. Mahayana also has its own scriptures in addition to the Pali Canon, the most important of which is the Lotus Sutra. These sutras are purported to be the Buddha&apos;s secret &quot;higher&quot; teachings, which were handed down only to those who were ready for them - an idea emphasised at the beginning of the Lotus Sutra. Apart from a modified monastic code which made monasticism possible in harsh environments such as Tibet, Mahayana emphasises the Bodhisattva Ideal, where a man vows not to achieve final enlightenment until all sentient beings have been saved. So anyone helping others to achieve enlightenment can be considered a bodhisattva. In Theravada, the term bodhisattva usually refers only to the historical Buddha in his previous lives. Historically, some Mahayanists consider Theravadins to be selfish for seeking enlightenment only for themselves, while some Theravadins consider Mahayanists to have deviated from what the Buddha taught. The various sutras and sects of Mahayana reflect different ways of reaching enlightenment appropriate for different people with different levels of ability. Because of this, a number of &quot;mythical&quot; buddhas and bodhisattvas are revered and used as objects of meditation. Theravadins revere only the historical Buddha and only his image is seen in temples. Mahayana tends to emphasise the concept of sunyata (void-ness) in its teachings and tends to have a more specific idea of what passes from rebirth to rebirth (consciousness, comprising awareness and memory). Personally, I found that the more I read about Mahayana and the Tibetan tradition known as Vajrayana, the more I accepted that all sects are going in the same direction and there is no point in considering any one of them better than another. Which tradition should I choose? I suggest reading about Theravada first and then investigating the other traditions to see which suits you best. Your decision may also depend on your Buddhist friends and what is available where you live. As far as I know, the main traditions known in the West are Theravada, Tibetan, Zen, Pure Land and Nichiren. One myth that seems to have grown up over the years is that with Mahayana one can reach enlightenment in one lifetime whereas with Theravada it takes aeons. This notion seems to have been pushed by the Chinese Zen patriarchs, in particular Huang Po, as illustrated in The Zen Teaching of Huang Po. In modern times the idea has been spread by influential author-scholar John Blofeld, who translated Huang Po&apos;s works into English and wrote several excellent books on Buddhism. But it all seems pretty ridiculous because how could anyone know how many lives ago any particular person started consciously working towards enlightenment? Blofeld followed Zen and then Tibetan Buddhist Tantrism, describing both as the &quot;Short Path.&quot; However, it isn&apos;t difficult to see that any tradition that emphasises meditation - as the Buddha did - will be a short path. In the past century, the Thai Forest Tradition is a good example of a Theravadin tradition that produced a number of enlightened masters. According to Blofeld, Mahayana and Tibetan Buddhism in particular offer ways of practice to suit people at every level. After all, not everyone has an aptitude for meditation. A lot of people prefer something simpler, such as praying, chanting, various forms of devotion and pilgrimages. He describes Zen and Theravada as &quot;formless,&quot; meaning the practice is mostly just you and your mind. But in fact there&apos;s a lot more to both than just meditation. Tibetan Buddhism seems to attract Westerners because there are now a lot of Tibetan lamas and monasteries in the West, because of the charisma of the Dalai Lama, because it can be a &quot;Short Path,&quot; because of its reputation for developing psychic powers and because of its many varied methods of practice. However, Tibetan Buddhism has absorbed much of the ancient, shamanistic Bon religion of Tibet, so it&apos;s wise to read up on Tibet thoroughly before committing to it. Zen attracts Westerners because it&apos;s something of a &quot;back to basics&quot; tradition with an emphasis on meditation and very little ritual. Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha, is revered rather than the other mythical buddhas and bodhisattvas of the Mahayana sutras. Although it originated in China, the type of Zen practised in the West is mostly Japanese. Theravada attracts Western practicioners because it is seen as the oldest and purest form of Buddhism, one that reveres only Sakyamuni and in theory concentrates on meditation. The Thai Forest Tradition which developed in the late 1800s was an effort to practise exactly as the Buddha did, wandering in the jungle and meditating in caves. Although the jungle is largely gone now, a number of Westerners joined Ajahn Chah&apos;s international monastery in the 1970s and later spread the practice in other countries: Ajahn Jagaro and Ajahn Brahm in Australia, Thanissaro Bhikkhu in the USA and Ajahn Sumedho in the UK. For a brief look at the origins of this tradition, see Thanissaro Bhikkhu&apos;s Customs of the Noble Ones. For a more detailed treatment, read Forest Recollections. Pure Land was once widespread in China and is still practised among Chinese around the world. A refined form of Pure Land (Jodo and Shin Jodo) developed in Japan and has spread to the West. Pure Land involves purifying the mind by chanting the name of the Amitabha (Amida) Buddha to gain help in reaching a realm after death from where it is easy to reach enlightenment. On a deeper level, Pure Land equals pure mind and Amitabha represents our own qualities rather than an external saviour. Pure Land is sometimes combined with Zen practice. Nichiren is a homegrown Japanese tradition advocating chanting of a phrase hailing the Lotus Sutra. An offshoot of Nichiren is the lay organisation, Sokka Gakai International. There are a few Buddhist sects and organisations that are controversial in some way, usually because of their founder/leader or his particular beliefs. Before getting involved with Sokka Gakai (SGI), the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO), Shugden or Diamond Way (Karma Kagyu), you might want to google for information about their background. How do I become a Buddhist? Although there is a ceremony of taking the Three Refuges (the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha), there isn&apos;t any &quot;conversion&quot; involved and you aren&apos;t required to renounce any other religion or beliefs. In fact, it seems to be more of a social statement to show others that you have become a Buddhist. In my opinion, once you accept the Buddha&apos;s teachings as a way of life and try to follow the Five Precepts for lay people, you&apos;re a Buddhist. For me, this involved a lot of reading Dharma and listening to Dharma talks on the Internet. Rather than read the scriptures (which are often difficult), I chose books by monks and nuns who already had a deep knowledge of Dharma through study and practice, and who had a talent for explaining it. I looked at how Buddhism developed over the millennia and decided to start off with Theravada, which is the original form of Buddhism based on the Pali Canon. Later, I investigated the various Mahayana traditions too. It was obvious to me that reducing the power of the ego to control our lives was a foundation of Buddhism. For my practice, I concentrated on Right Speech (a component of the Noble Eightfold Path) because I thought it would give the fastest results. I expected if I started being nice to people, eventually they&apos;d be nicer to me. That happened, but much more than that. I found myself examining my intentions every time I felt like defending my views, arguing with someone, contradicting them, criticizing them, comparing myself with them or judging them in any way at all. Pretty soon it was obvious that much of what I said or did was designed to boost my sense of self-worth and that &quot;true freedom&quot; was to escape this tyranny of the ego. Later I started meditating, since this is the only way to experience the truth of the teaching rather than just understanding them intellectually. Even though the majority of people born into Buddhism may not meditate, it&apos;s essential for the serious Buddhist. Some Westerners have a problem with whether they are or aren&apos;t a Buddhist, usually because they still have some belief in god or because they haven&apos;t come to believe in rebirth. The following talk by Ajahn Jagaro, a Western monk of the Thai Forest Tradition, will be helpful for anyone asking himself, &quot;Am I a Buddhist?&quot; ________________________________________ Am I a Buddhist? by Ajahn Jagaro Teaching people who have only recently encountered Buddhism I am often asked the question &quot;How do you become a Buddhist?&quot; or &quot;How do you know when you are a Buddhist?&quot; This type of enquiry is indeed healthy and to be encouraged not only amongst those new to Buddhism but also for people born and raised as Buddhists. So go ahead and ask yourself: &quot;Am I a Buddhist?&quot; I expect that there will be many who will answer &quot;Yes&quot; and those who say &quot;No&quot;, but I wonder how many will be thinking &quot;Oh ... Ahm,.. I don&apos;t know.&quot; So let us contemplate this business of being a Buddhist a bit more. To begin our enquiry it may be worthwhile to know what the Buddha said on the matter. The following episode is taken from the Buddhist scriptures (Anguttara Nikaya, Vol IV): &quot;Once, the Lord dwelt amongst the Sakyans in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu, and while there, Mahanama the Sakyan came to him and asked; &quot;How, Lord, does one become a lay disciple?&quot; &quot;When one has taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, then one is a lay disciple&quot;. &quot;How, Lord, is a lay disciple virtuous?&quot; &quot;When a lay disciple abstains from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and drinking intoxicants, then he is virtuous.&quot; Here th "], "triple": ["Theravada Buddhism", "is the dominant religion in", "Sri Lanka"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Sri_Lanka", "subject": "Theravada"}, "_id": 107242}

Last week January 16 in Atlanta a 30-man (est) SWAT team raided the offices of the Aphilliates Music Group. Several employees were detained, CDs, studio equipment, cars and bank accounts were confiscated, and DJ Drama &amp; DJ Don were arrested and later released on $100,000 bail. According to allhiphop.com they are being charged with the R.I.C.O. (Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations) laws, which were created to bring down the mafia and were used to attack the Black Panther party. Now one is probably thinking that this is another black eye for Hip-Hop. Another case of some one making it but just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave behind the lure of the streets. What did the police find? Guns? Drugs? No, the purpose of the action was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Mixtapes! I guess they were expecting more seeing how one of the agents said &quot;Usually, we find other crimes during these types of busts.&quot; But still, all of this over mixtapes? Well yes and no. The Players This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first time the RIAA has taken action like this and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good indicator that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the last. RIAA stands for Recording Industry Association of America (www.riaa.com). It is the trade group that represents the U.S. recording industry. Their Mission \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is to foster a business and legal climate that supports and promotes our member creative financial vitality\u00e2\u20ac? i.e.: make sure they make the money and survive. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come back to that word vitality in a moment. RIAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1995-year end report had a warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the growing popularity of illicit DJ mixes in CD format\u00e2\u20ac? (source NYT 6/16/05). On May 12th 2005, a day before the death of Legendary Justo Faison, founder of the Mixtape awards, RIAA announced a crackdown on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pirated CDs\u00e2\u20ac?. On June 8th 2005 a RIAA representative accompanied the New York Police on a raid of an east village video &amp; record store, Mondo Kims. Five employees were arrested and 100s of CDs were confiscated. The police seemed to focus on Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-stocked Hip Hop section. A RIAA official released a statement saying the police department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steadfast commitment to the fight against piracy has stamped out yet another significant illegal operation\u00e2\u20ac?. Now the Police have arrested and charged DJ Drama and DJ Don with RICO charges. In each major raid the RIAA was trying to send a message. Mondo Kims was popular record shop that was frequented by industry types and the like. DJ Drama, who is on the cover of this months issue of XXL, is arguably the #1 Mixtape DJ in the country right now. He picked up 4 trophies at the recent Justo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mixtape Awards, Just signed a deal with TI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (one of only 3 hip hop artist to have a platinum record this past year) Grand Hustle/Atlantic records, and his mixtapes series \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gansta Grillz\u00e2\u20ac? has a following that can challenge many Industry releases. In each case the association went after the big names to make a point that they were not playing around. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bust and raids that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the headlines that should be more alarming. According to one popular Boston Hip-Hop DJ, the same week that The Aphilliate Music Group was raided, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all mom &amp; pops stores that sold mixtapes were getting hit up 150gs each\u00e2\u20ac?. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s these attacks that tip the scales of making this an all out war on mixtapes and Hip-Hop in general. Decline of the OLD Media/Its Bigger than Hip Hop But why? Again we ask \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all over some mixtapes?\u00e2\u20ac? This is when we come back to that word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvitality\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In the RIAA mission its says their job is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153promote our members creative financial VITALITY\u00e2\u20ac?. Their client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vitality is endangered. The recording industry, in fact the whole media structure, as we know it IS DYING! Look at the numbers: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (USAToday 1/5/07) Overall album sales from 2001 were 712million. By 2004 they were 666.7million. And they are still dropping; compare 2005 sales\u00e2\u2020\u2019654.1 million to 2006 sales\u00e2\u2020\u2019 646.4 million. These drops don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be changing anytime soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (NYT 1/19/07) Time Inc. recently announced that it was cutting almost 300 jobs from its magazines in order to focus more on their websites. 172 coming from the editorial staff. Time Inc. is a unit of Time Warner, one of the 6 media conglomerates (G.E., Disney, News Corporation, Viacom, and CBS). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (WIRED Magazine 12/06) October 2006, NBC Universal announced a cut of 700 jobs as part of a $750 million retrenchment plan. Due to advertisers waning interest. They are being attacked from all sides: recording, print, T.V., radio, and the web. Because while all these drops have been happening there have been rises: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (USAtoday1/5/07) Digital track sales grew by 65% over 2005 and nearly caught album sales for the first time: 581.9 million tracks were sold, compared with 588.2 million albums. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (WIRED Magazine12/06) Youtube\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online audience grew from 5million in Jan 06 to over 35million in Aug 06. By Sept. 06 they were getting 70 thousand uploads and a 100million hits daily These are the 2 examples of the new media. The old structure is scrambling to get in because they are not equipped for it. A large part of that is because of how the new media is fueled. Not by YOU, as Time Magazine would like you to believe, but by EVERYONE. The record labels are trying to grab control of the digital album thing but that came about from them trying to stop the P2P file sharing. Myspace and Youtube would be nothing without millions of people providing the content. What makes that content so potent is the networking it opens up. Mixtapes create a grassroots distribution network that provides big name and unknown artist access to place where they could not have gotten on their own. The old structure was not built for the PEOPLE to have so much power. They are losing control and they know it. Instead of figuring what they may have done wrong to end up in this place, they come after the consumer and increasingly the producers and emergent network of this new medium. They shut down mom &amp; pop stores for selling mixtapes. They sue 12-year-old suburban kids for downloading music. They arrest mixtape DJs, that get their music sanctioned by the record execs, and confiscate all of their equipment. The Mixtape Game So what does DJ Drama &amp; DJ Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest mean for the future of mixtapes? Well for one it has terrorized the mixtape community. As you read this 100s of online mixtape sites are disappearing. The mixtape industry is moving more and more underground. Soon it might be easier to find an I Love Castro poster in Miami than to find a mixtape. What would that mean for Hip Hop? In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hip Hop, mixtapes are the corner stone. As a subaltern part of the record industry mixtapes have operated off the original essence of Hip Hop. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m neither being nostalgic nor purist. The first mixtapes started circulating around New York in the late 70s early 80s as DJ recordings of Hip-Hop Parties. You could hear the latest mc battles or the hot party you missed. It was one of the biggest reasons hip-hop was able to spread to all 5 boroughs of New York and across the country. Kid Capri is largely responsible for how we know mixtapes today. In mid 80s He began producing them in his house and made them clearer than the club versions. Down the line others innovated by taking acapellas and mixing them over different beats and creating the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exclusives\u00e2\u20ac? mixtapes (songs that have not yet been released by records labels). Along the way this progression has given rise to many things: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Alternative Economy: many local neighborhood store service mixtapes to communities, Many Previously unknown DJs and MCs blow up off of mixtapes. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Alternative distribution network: mom &amp; pop stores, street vendors, trunks of cars, and even some major retail outlets serve as part of a grassroots network \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Promotion service: Mixtape DJs break records better than mainstream corps. Primarily because of the relationship to the streets/people \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Alternative media: mixtapes are often experimental spaces for new styles, new beats. MCs and DJ often get away we saying and doing things on mixtapes that their major labels would let them. Many record labels (the same one that the RIAA say they are representing) caught on to the importance of this network. They give songs and money to DJs to make a mixtape around their artist. After 50cents meteoritic rise through the mixtape game, it would seem like some labels have a whole mixtape arm! Now here in lies what makes mixtapes, as opposed to downloading, difficult for the RIAA to tackle. They hold a peculiar position in that they help with sales and promotion of official albums while at the same time challenging copyright laws. Mixtapes like hip hop its self is a collaborative process. Remixing, sampling, tagging on a wall. All of these things challenge what we consider to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legal\u00e2\u20ac\u0153. Mixtapes push the barriers of the old copyright laws. May be its time we made new ones, to fit our reality and our culture. In Light of this state/corporate terror what can we do? Artists should start to look into creative commons licenses: www.creativecommons.org We can even create our own much like the FAM Foundation: http://freethiscd.com/ There are already examples of folk doing this: www.freshoutmedia.com/about-us Fresh out Media allows artists to upload their songs onto their website for free promotion under the creative commons license. The Hip Hop Media Lab, which produces mixtapes with independent artists, is starting to use a version of the creative commons license as well: www.myspace.com/hiphopmedialab With Hip Hop being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcKilled\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 maybe we can save it by doing what folks did in the beginning. Take what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been given and do our own thing. OPERATION RESTORE DRAMA is being set up to by Wend day to help support DJ Drama &amp; DJ Don.

The seven-days-a-week strip, which he has written and edited since its inception, is among the most successful of all syndicated adventure strips, appearing in 500 newspapers worldwide. Lee has written more than a dozen best-selling books, including &quot;The Origins of Marvel Comics,&quot; &quot;The Silver Surfer,&quot; &quot;How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way,&quot; &quot;Bring on the Bad Guys,&quot; &quot;The Superhero Women,&quot; &quot;The Best of the Worst&quot; and &quot;Riftworld,&quot; a science-fiction paperback series.

In 1988, Lee produced and narrated a videocassette based on his &quot;How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way&quot; book. More recently, he collaborated with Stabur Video in a series of videotapes titled &quot;Stan Lee Presents the Comicbook Greats,&quot; in which he interviews top artists and writers. His animated TV production, &quot;The X-Men,&quot; which appears Saturday mornings on Fox, has been No. 1 in the ratings since its inception.

Past the half-way stage in this 11-round event that has one rapid and one blindfold game in each round, the Indian ace now occupies sole second spot and also bridged the gap between him and the leader Levon Aronian of Armenia who played out draws with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan in both the games. It is still a tight affair and there is no clear winner in sight. With five rounds still to go, Aronian is at the top of the combined points table on 7.5 while Anand is now close behind with seven points in his kitty. Five players are just half a point adrift of Anand at joint third. They are Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, Peter Leko of Hungary, Vladimir Kramnik of Russia [Images], Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and Magnus Carlsen of Norway. Anand misread an opening move in the blindfold game but thankfully there was no damage. The Indian ace mistakenly believed that Karjakin had moved his knight on the queen side when in fact it was on the king side and upon realising his mistake Anand was quick to recover. Despite the mistake, by the 23rd move the writing was on the wall when Anand played a crushing rook move to tighten the noose around his opponent. In the rapid game there was little for Karjakin as Anand yet again was on top from the beginning. However, it was not as bad as in the blindfold and somehow the Ukrainian youngster was able to maintain the balance. The game was eventually drawn. The blindfold game between Carlsen and Topalov may go down in Amber history as the &apos;Great Escape&apos;. The Bulgarian played another Caro-Kann and though he was doing fine, Carlsen missed a dangerous attack in the middle game.\ufffd Topalov reached a winning position only to see Carlsen begin his survival act. Topalov had eight minutes on his clock and the young Norwegian was down to seconds, but that didn&apos;t stop him from tricking his opponent. The game was eventually drawn. Topalov&apos;s misery continued in the rapid game as he failed to finish off from a winning position again. Carlsen defended with great tenacity and earned a draw when the position was repeated three times on 69th move. Round 6 Results: (Blindfold) Sergey Karjakin (Ukr) lost to Viswanathan Anand (Ind); Levon Aronian (Arm) drew with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze); Magnus Carlsen (Nor) drew with Veselin Topalov (Bul); Vassily Ivanchuk (Ukr) drew with Peter Leko (Hun); Loek Van Wely (Ned) lost to Alexander Morozevich (Rus); Boris Gelfand (Isr) drew with Vladimir Kramnik (Rus). (Rapid) Anand drew with Karjakin; Mamedyarov drew with Aronian; Topalov dew with Carlsen; Leko drew with Ivanchuk; Morozevich drew with Van Wely; Kramnik drew with Gelfand.

July 1867 in Watkins Glen, New York - d. September 8, 1934 in Tudor City apartments, New York, New York) and Maud A. Humphrey (1867-1941). Belmont and Maud were married in June 1898. His father&apos;s ancestors were of Dutch, English, and Spanish origin. Bogart is a Dutch name meaning &quot;orchard&quot;. His mother&apos;s were largely of English descent and to a lesser extent Welsh. Bogart&apos;s father was a Presbyterian, while his mother was an Episcopalian. Bogart was raised in his mother&apos;s Episcopal church.", "Trivia Answer: Humphrey DeForest Bogart who was born on Christmas of 1899. His films include The Big Sleep (1946), Key Largo (1948) opposite his wife Lauren Bacall, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), The African Queen (1951) for which he won his only Academy Award (for Best Actor), and The Caine Mutiny (1954). Bogart was born in New York City. His birthdate has been a subject of controversy. It was long believed that his birthday on Christmas Day 1899 was a Warner Bros. fiction created to romanticize his background, and that he was really born on January 23, 1899, a date that appears in many references. However, this story is now considered baseless. Although no birth certificate has ever been found, his birth notice did appear in a Boston newspaper in early January 1900, which supports the December 1899 date. Bogart was a liberal Democrat. He organized a delegation to Washington, D.C., called the Committee for the First Amendment during the height of McCarthyism, against the House Un-American Activities Committee&apos;s harassment of Hollywood writers and actors. It&apos;s a little known fact that Bogart was an excellent chess player, almost of master strength. Before he made any money from acting, he would hustle players for dimes and quarters playing in New York parks and at Coney Island. The chess scenes in Casablanca had not been in the original script, but were put in at his insistence. By the mid-1950s, Bogart&apos;s health was failing. He was a heavy smoker and contracted cancer of the esophagus. He almost never spoke of his failing health and refused to see a doctor until January of 1956. A diagnosis was made several weeks later and by then removal of his esophagus, two lymph nodes, and a rib was too late to halt the disease, even with chemotherapy. Bogart had just turned 57 and weighed 80 pounds when he died on January 14th of 1957 after falling into a coma. His funeral was attended by some of Hollywood&apos;s biggest stars including: Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, David Niven, Ronald Reagan, James Mason, Danny Kaye, Joan Fontaine, Marlene Dietrich, Errol Flynn, Gregory Peck, and Gary Cooper, as well as Billy Wilder and Jack Warner."], "triple": ["Bogart", "was born in", "New York City"], "kbp_info": [["PERSON", "per:city_of_birth", "LOCATION"], ["PERSON", "per:cities_of_residence", "LOCATION"], ["PERSON", "per:city_of_birth", "LOCATION"]], "entity_linking": {"object": "New_York_City", "subject": "Humphrey_Bogart"}, "_id": 13276}

He makes you believe in this character and understand his travails. His reactions to everything are a beauty to watch, whether it\u2019s being threatened by the Fat Man or threatening Brigid.

Again, it\u2019s craft over skill, but, as I said, everything in this film is well-crafted. Even Mary Astor, a good but not great actress, benefits from Huston\u2019s sure hand.

Notches and grooves appear on one or both sides of a foundation-line [druim]. Each letter was named for a different tree, e.g. a = ailm [pine], b = beithe [birch], etc., Designations for the letters q, v, and z, which are not used in Irish, support the now widely accepted interpretation of ogham as an expression of Irish through the Latin alphabet. The current view displaces many colourful speculations on ogham&apos;s origin: runic alphabet of Scandinavia, Chalcidic Creek, northern Etruscan, etc. Ogham inscriptions date primarily from the 4th to 5th centuries and are found mainly on standing stones; evidence for inscriptions in wood exists, but examples do not survive. The greatest concentration of surviving ogham inscriptions is in southern Ireland; a 1945 survey found 121 in Kerry and 81 in Co. Cork, while others are scattered throughout Ireland, Great Britain, and the Isle of Man, with five in Cornwall, about thirty in Scotland, mainly in &apos;Pictish&apos; areas, and more than forty in Wales. South Wales was an area of extensive settlement from southern Ireland, including the migration of the De&apos;isi. Ogham was also used for Pictish. In Wales, ogham inscriptions have both Irish and Brythonic-Latin adjacent inscriptions. Most ogham inscriptions are very short, usually consisting of a name and a patronymic in the genitive case. They are of linguistic rather than literary interest, because they show an older state of the Irish language than found in any other written sources. Many appear to be memorials to the dead, while others mark the border between two lands. Although the knowledge of ogham was never lost to scholars (at least one 19th-cent. grave-marker uses it), the notion that ogham was employed for occult or magical purposes dogs critical commentary. As late as the 1930s the eminent archaeologist R. A. S. Macalister proposed that ogham was part of the secret language of &apos;druidic freemasonry&apos;. Se\u00e1n O&apos;Boyle suggested (1980) that the key to explaining ogham is harp notation. The god of rhetoric and eloquence, Ogma, is an attributed creator; his name and the word appear to be philologically related. See..

Guangzhou is located in the middle south of Guangdong Province, north of the Pearl River Delta. It lies close to the South China Sea, Hong Kong, and Macau. Zhujiang (The Pearl River), the third largest river of China, runs through Guangzhou and is navigable to the South China Sea. Situated in such an excellent geographical region, Guangzhou is called China&apos;s South Gate. Covering an area of 7434.4 square kilometers (2870 square miles), Guangzhou is home to more than 11 million people, including a 3.7 million transitory population. With the opening of China to the outside world, a large number of people from other regions of China swarmed into Guangzhou, one of the first &apos;open&apos; cities in China. This has accelerated its economic development. Guangzhou is a famous historical city. In ancient days, Guangzhou was the capital city for three Chinese dynasties: the Nan Yue (South Yue), the Nan Han (South Han) and the Nanming (South Ming). Thus it was put in the list of the 24 most famous historical cultural cities and became a tourist destination. You can not understand most Chinese cities deeply until you know their history. This is true of Guangzhou. Many historic sights: the Western Han Nanyue King&apos;s Tomb Museum, the Zhenhai Tower and the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall tell us the 2,000-year history of Guangzhou. Today, Guangzhou retains its ancient customs, but is also a large city full of vigor and current fashions. You can find something worth taking home in Shangxia Jiu Lu, Beijing Lu and Di Shi Fu Lu. Trying Yue Cai (Cantonese Cuisine), one of eight Chinese famous cuisines, is definitely a must in Guangzhou! Eat delicious food with ingredients you have never heard of. Hotel facilities and service in Guangzhou are fine. A word of warning: Do make a reservation beforehand if you decide to visit Guangzhou during the Canton Fair. For visitors, especially those plan to attend the Canton Fair, transportation in Guangzhou is more and more convenient. You can choose plane, train, ship or bus. Guangzhou is famous as a hometown for overseas Chinese. It boasts the largest population of overseas Chinese people. These overseas Chinese do a great deal of good for Guangzhou: opening international markets, bridging Guangzhou and the rest of the world, and establishing many schools, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens and rest homes in Guangzhou. \u00a0", "Guangzhou is the capital city of Guangdong, and the center of its political, economic, scientific, educational and cultural life.

A new study says ancient snow on top of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania could be gone in about twenty years. Huge layers of ice formed on the African mountain during a wet period about eleven-thousand years ago. But scientists say the ice on top of the mountain is melting because of rising temperatures in recent years. Lonnie Thompson of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio led the study. It was published in Science magazine. The scientists used maps, modern navigational satellites and markers placed on the mountain to measure the ice. They found that the ice on Mount Kilimanjaro has shrunk from about twelve square kilometers in nineteen-twelve to about two square kilometers today. That is about an eighty percent reduction in the ice. Scientists say the ice will be gone by two-thousand-twenty if it continues to melt at its current rate. Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. It is almost five-thousand-nine-hundred meters high. The top part of the mountain is covered with snow. The mountain rises above flat land, called the savannah. The land is home to many different kinds of animals. Many stories have been written about the famous mountain. The most famous is Ernest Hemingways The Snows of Kilimanjaro. Some ancient beliefs in Africa consider the mountain to be a holy place. About twenty-thousand people visit Mount Kilimanjaro every year to see the famous snow-topped mountain. It even has its own international airport. The government of Tanzania fears that the melting ice will affect tourism and weaken the economy. The decreasing ice already has reduced the amount of water flowing from the mountain to some Tanzanian rivers. Water from the mountain supplies many villages. The scientists are working to save pieces of the shrinking ice for more study. The frozen layers tell about Africas weather in ancient times. The ice also provides information about the worlds climate. Experts say other ice glaciers around the world are melting because of climate change caused by human activities. But they say natural climate change could be the cause of Mount Kilimanjaros problems.

Before that, he served as chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thain resigned from Bank of America Thursday following news that Merrill Lynch had rushed out its year-end bonuses, paying them just before Bank of America completed its acquisition of Merrill Lynch and sought $20 billion in additional government bailout money. The company gave no reason for Thain&apos;s departure, but its timing, coming hours after news reports about the bonuses, made it likely that there was a connection with the payouts. The bonuses to Merrill Lynch executives were also paid out as the company prepared to report a $15.3 billion fourth-quarter loss -- a loss that led Bank of America to request and receive government funds on top of the $25 billion it had already been given. Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri issued a terse statement: &quot;(BofA Chairman and CEO) Ken Lewis flew to New York today to talk to John Thain. And it was mutually agreed that his situation was not working out and he would resign.&quot; The bonuses raise the question of how proper it was for executives in a struggling company to be given big payments even as its soon-to-be-parent was accepting billions of dollars in government money. &quot;He&apos;s just completely tone-deaf to the culture of BofA&quot; if he was paying out bonuses days before reporting a multibillion dollar quarterly loss and as Lewis was securing more government support, Tony Plath, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said about Thain. &quot;My surprise is the board gave him an opportunity to resign and didn&apos;t just fire him.&quot; Silvestri said Bank of America was informed of Thain&apos;s decision to grant the bonuses. It was not immediately known what fallout from the bonuses there might be for Lewis. &quot;Merrill was an independent company until Jan. 1 of 2009,&quot; Silvestri said. &quot;John Thain decided to pay year-end incentives in December, as opposed to their normal date in January. Bank of America was informed of his decision.&quot; Bonuses were not paid to Thain and four other top executives -- President and COO Greg Fleming, Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai, President of Global Wealth Management Robert McCann and General Counsel Rosemary Berkery -- who requested they not receive additional compensation. Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America has increasingly come under criticism in recent weeks for its acquisition of Merrill Lynch, a deal fostered by the government to save Merrill Lynch on the same day that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed amid the ballooning credit crisis. There is also concern among government officials about banks that have received bailout funds still going ahead with yearend bonuses. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo&apos;s office has started an investigation into the &quot;secret, last-minute&quot; bonuses paid out by Merrill, according to an individual familiar with the investigation who asked for anonymity because it is ongoing. Thain was heading a wealth management division of the two firms&apos; merged businesses. Some analysts expected him to leave at some point soon even without the bonus issue -- when two huge companies link up, the usual turn of events is that one of the CEOs from the standalone companies departs. &quot;It&apos;s hard to see Ken Lewis and John Thain together in a working relationship,&quot; said Gary Townsend, president of private investment group Hill-Townsend Capital. &quot;Thain is the quintessential Wall Street fellow. Lewis spent a lot of time on Wall Street and hated the experience.&quot; Lewis, in the past, has spoken out about his dislike of the investment banking business. In October 2007, after Bank of America posted a 32 percent drop in third quarter profit, hurt heavily by investment banking results, Lewis said: &quot;I&apos;ve had all of the fun I can stand in investment banking at the moment. So to get bigger in it is not something I really want to do.&quot; Soon after the announcement of Thain&apos;s departure, Bank of America named its general counsel, Brian Moynihan, to succeed him. With Thain gone, Paul Miller, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co., said Lewis is likely to wind down many parts of Merrill&apos;s operations as he integrates the investment bank. Lewis picked up Merrill with his eyes on the retail brokerage business, Miller said. Internally, Bank of America has spent heavily in recent years to build out an investment banking group, but it was still much smaller than Wall Street peers. While retail brokerage might be appealing to Lewis and Bank of America, Miller said the riskier parts of the business are likely to be shut down, possibly including the fixed income and structured finance divisions. Thain went to Merrill Lynch, which like other financial companies was struggling because of its investments in soured mortgage back securities, after leading the New York Stock Exchange. Before that, he served as chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thain went to Merrill Lynch, which like other financial companies was struggling because of its investments in soured mortgage back securities, after leading the New York Stock Exchange.

David Arnold offered the use of AIR Studios in London, but in his characteristic single-mindedness, Rice chose to record in his bedroom instead. The results are exactly what one hears on O. At nearly double-Platinum status in his native Ireland, Rice has received three nominations in the 2003 Meteor Ireland Music Awards. In the UK, critics heaped praised on the album and this year Rice has sold out the Union Chapel and Shepherds Bush Empire. Since well before the US release of O, Rice has been selling-out shows at prestigious venues across the States. Rice is deliberate about his art, and its increasingly rewarding. Still, he maintains a commitment to spontaneity, improvisation and living in the moment. Each show is different from the last, and he never plays a song the same way twice. The crowds are coming and thats exciting, he says. On the other hand, it creates a bigger expectation to deliver something, and a bigger challenge not to think about delivering anything."], "triple": ["Rice", "became the lead singer of", "Juniper"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Juniper", "subject": "Damien_Rice"}, "_id": 92028}

The evidence is a little muddled but there is too much debris on the road to dismiss it. It started with the drug reference from the Clinton campaign worker; next was Black Entertainment Televisions Bob Johnson. Bill Clintons fairy tale statement was mixed in there, all of it rising to create division. Now, Mrs. Clinton all but abandoned South Carolina this week. Does she want black votes or is she winking to the rest of America saying, see I told you, Obama is just like the other black candidate hes black? The result of all of this: Clinton is over here with America and Obama, well, look, he is over there with the blacks. How can you be the Tiger Woods of politics if you are over there with the blacks in mass? It is an odd strategy but yet one that has taken African-Americans to the crossroads where the following question is pondered: If Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic nomination, do we forgive and forget like in 1992 or do we send a message to the Clintons James Brown style ala the Big Payback. This time it is probably the Big Payback. Before Clinton ventures too much futher down this road, somone should remind her\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdabout Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and the price for fumbling the racial football in an election. Townsend, a member of the Kennedy political family, angered blacks in Maryland when she ran for governor of Maryland in 2003. She was very popular and was Lieutenant Governor for 8 years prior to her run\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd However, Townsend failed to offer an African-American the slot as her running mate despite the fact that African-Americans make up 30 percent of the black vote in Maryland. Highly qualified African-Americans didnt even get serious consideration right before Townsend tacked to the right and chose a much more conservative white running mate. Prince Georges County, Maryland, one of the most powerful African-American voting blocs in the nation, was outraged, and Townsends high office ambitions died. Townsend turned her back on African-Americans, but, under the Bush administration, the country is turning its back on everyone. Things can get worse but no one actually expects Hillary Clinton to do much more than her husband did. Besides, his presidency is incredibly overrated. More black men went to jail under Bill Clinton than under Ronald Reagan and he did not openly and aggressively try to end the drug war policy that did it. In fact, in 1994, he signed into law a bill that made sure they did go to jail. The result of these policies: thousands of black men will not vote in November 2008 because of Clintons policies relating to the war on drugs. On affirmative action, he urged the country to mend it but dont end it. Of course, it would have been more honest and honorable to say:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd affirmative action is an overrated and limited remedial race policy designed to try to rectify a small part of the countrys legacy of slavery and segregation. But what is most troubling about the Clinton tactics is they are trying to win an election with the same scorched earth policy they have made famous for decades. If Obamas blackness must be highlighted so whites on the fence will flock to us, so be it, give us those dirty votes too. In 1990\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdHarvey Gannt, former Mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, was about to beat Jesse Helms for his Senate seat in 1990. Gantt, like Obama, was a nice guy, a rising star, and a guy who downplayed race. Helms had played nice for most of the campaign but most knew he wouldnt sit pat the whole time. As the election approached, he pulled out the big guns he ran a famous anti-affirmative action ad called Hands against Gantt that made the good people of North Carolina remember that Gantt was, in fact, black. Helms surged to a victory that was doubtful just weeks before the election. But Jesse Helms never really needed the black vote to win in North Carolina. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, cannot afford to lose much of the black vote and win. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton should call Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.

I mean granted, different series/different team, but it just goes to show you that anything can happen. I&apos;d love to see Dice on his game, Ortiz and the rest of the lineup hitting bombs, and the bullpen being pretty much awesome. Of course, if it doesn&apos;t happen, then that&apos;s okay too. I&apos;d prefer to see a win on the board, however. Are you guys ready?

During the War of 1812, Chapman traveled 30 miles to bring troops to Mansfield, Ohio, to forestall a raid by Indian allies of the British.

This fits in well with the general Greek and Roman tradition of holy men, and so did Montanus by all accounts: he had long hair and bare feet and looked like other Eastern prophets.

LACK OF SELF ANALYSIS and SELF REFLECTION 2.) Martin Heidegger Metaphysics is Dasein which is: AN AUTHENTIC BEING AND A BEING-ANTICIPATING-DEATH 3.) Martin Heidegger DASEIN is applicable and helpful towards development of Filipino values especially in inculcating PATRIOTISM and NATIONAL PRIDE through resolving Filipino lack of discipline and Colonial Mentality. 4.) That Heidegger Metaphysics of DASEIN could be an alternative solution and efficient strategy to Filipino problems about economic progress. SCOPE AND DELIMITATIONS The study discusses the qualities of Filipino people which are responsible for their development and progress as a person and as a society. These qualities are PAKIKIPAGKAPWA-TAO, FLEXIBILITY, ADAPTABILITY, CREATIVITY and ABILITY TO SURVIVE, which the author sees as helpful for Filipino people in competing among other nations. And the other qualities, like LACK OF DISCIPLINE and COLONIAL MENTALITY that hinders them to succeed and achieve their goal in life. Filipinos, in order to succeed is to know these qualities. Without being aware of these qualities they have, one could not possibly maximize the good or avoid the evil qualities. Thus, the application of Metaphysics of Martin Heidegger is an important philosophy which the author sees as useful for Filipino people for them to be able to determine one from the other. The study focuses on how Heidegger Dasein can resolve Filipino problems toward their discipline and colonial mentality in order to promote patriotism and national pride. DEFINITION OF TERMS Anticipation- the feeling of looking forward. Change- modification for betterment Dasein- Heidegger metaphysics Death- condition or quality of being dead. Filipino- somebody who was born in the Philippines or who has Philippine citizenship. Imitation- synthetic, intended as a copy of something, or not genuine. Heidegger, Martin-(1889-1976), German philosopher, who developed existential phenomenology and has been widely regarded as the most original 20th-century philosopher. Heidegger was born in Messkirch, Baden, on September 22, 1889. Patriotism- pride in or devotion to the country somebody was born in or is a citizen of Pride- the correct level of respect for the importance and value of your personal character, life, effort or achievements. Submit- to give in to somebody authority, control or demands Success- achievement of something CHAPTER TWO STUDY OF RELATED LITERATURE he Phony State(p.1-10) in Ang Konsepto ng Lipunan ni Renato Constantino by Dr. Mark Edwin Aspra According to the author as he narrated Constantino philosophy about society, our country is fake or phony. The reason why he call our society phony is because people living in this country tries to live according to what he sees and imitates to other people. That Filipino do not have an original conception of life but all are borrowed from other nations. That Filipino people continue to deny their identity. That our principles are brought out and was shaped by our colonial mentality. According to the author, our phony society was rooted in our aspiration to be like the westerners. And because we used to imitate other nations, we tend to rely on them economically, politically and even intellectually. We become American extension. We act like as if we are American people. We freely submit ourselves unto them and surrender our national values allowing the American to shape and control us. For the author, living in a phony society is like lacking purpose and do not have a strong principle toward life. Our conception of Democracy mirrors how phony our society is. Because until now, we consider our government as irresponsible to help us and we do not believe in them as an institutions that could make us a better person. We follow rules not because we believe in what the government has implemented but only because we are afraid of punishment. Until now, we do not consider our government as our own. The kind of mentality that we used to have before. Corruption as a cancerous disease in our society can be traced along our colonial mentality and according to the author it can only be cured through nationalism. We become corrupt because we try to imitate others. But if we have a strong determination to change by valuing our own and living a life of our own, we can possibly destroy the fantastic view about life. ISIPANG KOLONYAL- BALAKID SA PAG-UNLAD Venancio Ramos De Los Reyes, Jr. The author defines Colonial Mentality as believing that everything, from products to people, that are from other country are better than our own. Our desire to look like westerners when we blond our hairs, when we buy whitening products, when we do noselift are some manifestations of having colonial minds. The author added that even in our highways, coloniality among Filipinos can be seen when almost of them wanted to own a car which was from abroad. Most of us prefer to have an imported good rather than products made in Philippines. We have this thinking that a product coming from abroad seems effective and has a greater value compare to ours. Even in our commercials, in order for us to call the attention of the consumers, we even have to say that the product we endorse was tested and approved abroad. Even in our sports, in our film industry, colonial mentality had already stained in the fabric of every Filipinosmentality. If we continue being this way, we can never attain progress. Unless, we learn the need to know ourselves and begin to love it. If we do not believe in ourselves, who else then will believe us? The author stated that progress and development begin within us. That nobody will do that for us but with our own initiatives and self evaluation, we can possibly grow and be a better person. SELF-RELIANCE by Ralph Waldo Emerson nvy is ignorance. Imitation is suicide.The essay Self-Reliance tackles about human being quest for independence and self-fulfillment, through self- reliance. But there are hindrances or obstacles to achieve it. And these are conformity, lack of trust on oneself, imitations, and inconsistency. Man will never know what he can do until he tries and will never be relieved unless he puts his heart into his work and done his best. Because men measure their esteem of each other by what each has and not by what each is, they end up being unhappy and discontented. The author added that we find easy to live after the world opinion. When we accords toward what society dictates but he said, great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. I AM NATURE GREATEST MIRACLE by Og Mandino will winor I am unique. I am nature greatest miracle.If we have this thinking, success is never impossible to reach. The essay teaches us that man is unique among his brothers. That nobody can walk and talk and move and think exactly the way one does. Nobody has the ability to duplicate one ability and strength for man is rare and he has to value his rarity. Because he is indeed, valuable. Man skill and mind will stagnate, rot and die if one do not put it in good use but just submit himself to others. Man has unlimited potentials. But only a small portion of this potential is felt because only little effort is exerted. Men are here for a purpose, and that purpose is to grow. Growth means applications of all effort to become somebody not to rely one development to others. Man should not be deceived of what he sees but has to be keen to see what is in his inside and realize that he is the nature greatest miracle. CHAPTER THREE METHODOLOGY Although many studies had already been done about Filipinos nationalism and patriotism, the author still see the need for another additional discussion on the topic and attempts to deliver some not-so-mentioned-strategy toward Filipinos development. The author chooses the topic and Philosophy of Martin Heidegger for she believes this philosophy is relevant and significant that could somehow help her fellowmen to realize their shortcomings and enhances their potentials. The main sources of data for this study were from review of some related literature about Filipinos colonial Mentality and submissive to foreign country and some study that also tackles the same topic. The author used descriptive method in this study. The author went to several libraries to research for necessary materials that she will use in this study. These libraries includes Dasmarinas Library and Aklatang Emilio Aguinaldo where she found some discussions included in the study. The author also surf the internet for a quick access on the materials she needs. CHAPTER FOUR PRESENTATION OF DATA We are facing a grave national crisis in our country--Economic instability, crimes, corruptions of government officials, devaluation of peso, flood, and poverty. These are all felt everywhere and the need for progress is the first goal every Filipino want to achieve right now at the earliest possible time. We all need development. We all need prosperity and success for a well living. But we never tried longing for CHANGE. We long for a quick progress to lift our economic standard yet we never tried looking on what we really need for what we dream of. WE NEED CHANGE FOR A CHANGE. And this change can never be attained if we do not change as a community, as a person. THE FILIPINOSTRUE COLOR: Filipinos, among Asian race has many potentials and qualities to be proud of. Qualities that if only being properly utilized will bring them success. 1. PAKIKIPAG-KAPWA TAO Filipinos are known to this attitude. They are open to others and feel one with others. They are helpful and has concern for others. They value their friends thus they begin to be loyal to them and regard them with respect and unquestionable concern.. They show gratitude among their fellows and they can easily make friends. They will sacrifice and even offer their lives for other people. They will give as much as they have and will lend you help even they have no longer food to eat. According to Licuanan, et al, this Pakikipagkapwa-tao of Filipinos brings out camaraderie and feeling of closeness to one another. And it is the foundation for unity as wellas the sense of social justice. 2. FILIPINOS ARE FLEXIBLE Unplanned or unanticipated events are never overly disturbing or disorienting as the Flexible Filipino adjusts to whatever happens.One of the Filipinos attributes which made Filipinos known abroad. Filipinos can perform any task being given to him. They can shift one work from another with the same performance. They can easily adjust to the nature of work given to them. The result is productivity, innovation, and survival. 3. ADAPTABILITY Filipinos can easily adapt to another place whatever the circumstances maybe. Wherever they go, they can easily learn the nature of the place and the people living in it, thus making them easy to live and get along with them. The results are survival and enterpreneurship. 3. CREATIVITY Filipinos are creative and resourceful people. We are quick learners. Example of this is the Ifugaoswidely known Rice Terraces or Hagdan hagdan Palayan. They can make something out of what they can get from trees or stones and pebbles. Filipinos have always something in mind which if only being supported by the government can compete to foreign resources. Filipino products are indeed more creative and more fashionable than other products. The results are inventions, productivity and development. 4. ABILITY TO SURVIVE Because Filipinos are by nature fighter, whatever pains they have to go through could not hinder them to live.. Filipinos are survivor. They have been conquered by foreign countries but still they get by to survive. These certain qualities of Filipinos can lead them to overcome poverty. But because of wrong interpretations and misuse of these qualities it has become their weaknesses. And the Weaknesses are as follows: 1. LACK OF DISCIPLINE Filipino lacks discipline in their work. We have a casual and relaxed attitude toward time and space. We have a poor management of our time. We are disorganized when it comes to obligations and compromisions. For the westerners, ime wasted is gone foreve but for Filipino, here is always tomorrowwhich is reflected in our maxims, aglipas ng dilim, may umagang darating.(Mercado.93:112-113). The BAHALA NA SYNDROME are manifested in his attitude toward his work. Bahala na means leaving matters as they are leaving nature to take its course. It is contraction of the word athala nameaning od will take care This shows Filipinos strong faith to their creator yet wrong notions such as predestinations, uerte ula adhanawere developed among Filipinos. Which led them to endure sufferings, poverty tragedy and enables them to accept pain and frustrations with tolerance. Another is NINGAS COGON. ( a grass fire). It means great enthusiasm of Filipinos to their work that marks the start of a project or of a new organization but the interest eventually dies down as days passes by. This attitude gives them unfinished work and unattained success. Resulting to inefficiency and wasteful work systems, poor service and transgressions. Filipino indolence or atamaranwere charged by Spaniards.(Pilar.1981:48) For other people, this attitude brought out our poverty. Because Filipino LACKS INITIATIVE and ambitions they seldom achieve something . They have to wait to be told what has to be done. They always rely on others. Especially in the presence of authority which they securely submit themselves. Filipinos have small dreams thus they have small achievements. Although Rizal refuted this charge as he explained that this perception only came about because of Spanish colonizations, this attitude has become part of Filipinos nature. 2. COLONIAL MENTALITY ilipinos have colonial mentality which is made up of two dimensions: the first is lack of PATRIOTISM or of an active awareness, appreciation and love of the Philippines; and the second is an actual preference for things foreign. Schwenk. 1989: 17). Filipinos are very passive people. Indeed, they can easily adapt and adjust to new environment yet Filipinos when they have already adjusted to a certain place, they easily give in and incorporate themselves to the nature of the society and forget their own identity. Sometimes, their notion of survival is to be socially accepted and please other people which led them to imitate and desire to be like other people which they think is cceptable Filipinos submit their identity to another identity to be acknowledged and to succeed. Being like the other is their perception as being nand desirable. Even in the way one speaks, the color of the skin, the food that they eat are all borrowed to foreign countries. This attitude of PASSIVITY among Filipinos was brought about their LACK OF SELF ANALYSIS and SELF REFLECTION. Filipinos seldom know themselves. That is why until now, seldom knows what they want in life. Almost of us long to succeed but the steps to success were taken for granted because we do lack self evaluation and analysis. Knowing what we want is knowing how to get them. And knowing how to get them is knowing our abilities and limitations to achieve it. But Filipinos do not know these and even seldom question what they can do for them to succeed yet often pursue to their dreams without analyzing their capabilities and stand. Filipinos weaknesses continue to shrink our potentials. And it is very clear that we have much good in us but there is much more that needs to be changed. And if we do not do anything to overcome theseit will not be our weakness anymorebut will become our identity. So what can we do to overcome this? Is there any possibility that Filipinos can still change and succeed? Maybe yesf we only be authentic as Martin Heidegger Dasein. THE METAPHYSICS OF MARTIN HEIDEGGER Heidegger was influenced by the pre-Socratics of Greek philosophy, by the Danish Soren Kierkegaard, and by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. His most important and influential work, is Being and Time(1927). Heidegger attempts to uncover the basic structures of human existence-such as concern and mood-in virtue of which knowledge and understanding are possible. He said that we are self-interpreting, deciding entities practically involved along with others in a world that we have not made but that consists of potential useful things, including cultural as well as natural objects. And because these objects and artifacts come to humanity from the past and are used in the present for the sake of future goals, Heidegger posited a fundamental relation between the mode of being of objects and of humanity and the structure of time. He argues that a person usual understanding is dictated by the anonymous ublicor hem and that the individual authenticity-the prospect of which is experienced in the state of anxiety-requires distancing from hemand esolutelyforging one own rojectsand view of things. The individual is, however, always in danger of being submerged in the world of objects, everyday routine, and the conventional, shallow behavior of the crowd. This sense of potential individuality is reinforced by the sober recognition of mortality, since a person own death, and the way he faces up to it, is something that is uniquely his or her own. BEING The question of being is considered superfluous and is the most general and is undefinable. Being seems to be already included in all that we grasp of things. But because of lack of understanding of what being really is, grave misunderstanding arises. Yet for heidegger, in the question of being, the one who asks is himself a being. The interrogator of being is already a being himself. By asking what being is, the interrogator asks what he himself is. Heidegger believes, and with reason, that we cannot hope to understand being without first of all understanding what we ourselves are. Man is the key to the understanding of being. But the fact remains that not all men attempt to understand what they are or who they are. Thus, Heidegger was compelled to group men into two classes: the authentic man (Dasein) and the inauthentic man (das Man). DASEIN and DAS MAN Dasein is Heidegger way of referring both to the human being and to the type of being that humans have. It comes from the verb dasein, which means o existor o be there, to be here The noun dasein is used by other philosophers, by kant for example, for the existence of entity. But heidegger restricts it to human being. And human being as a dasein is questioners, choosers and self-producers. Dasein is possibility. And is prior to his actuality. And has three characteristics: He is hurdled into the world and found there (Befindlichkeit) and realizes that he is thrown (Geworfen) and has more control over its own being; he understands (Verstehen) that while being abandoned in the world, he has to realize a future. He therefore must understand the ultimate connection between an impoverished, weakened past and an unfulfilled future. Dasein is an entity that can decide whether to be or not to be. Yet cannot become whatever it wants because circumstamces places restrictions on what one does. On the other hand, das Man never asks himself what he is, hence does not have a sense of abandonment. His existence is that of ambiguity and his involvement is ambiguous because he does even not know what he is or why he is. Instead of understanding which is characteristic of dasein, das Man is impelled by curiosity and because of lack of true understanding, his mode of speech is that of idle or silly speeches.

If your reading this then congratulations on getting your new betta! Or congratulations for study about your betta before purchasing! Bettas make great pets, require very little care and are so much fun to watch! They come in a whole array of colors, with each one having their own personality. Be careful, it&apos;s very easy to become a bettaholic! \u00a0 So lets start with the basics. Betta Splendens originated in Thailand, from the slow running rice paddy fields. Once discovered people found out that the males were ferocious towards each other and very territorial. People soon made a sport out of them, by fighting them and gambling, much like dog fighting or chicken fighting, hence the name Siamese Fighting Fish. Which is why you always see them sitting in separate cups at the petstores. Never put male bettas together! They will fight until one kills the other. \u00a0 Now what will be your bettas new home? Your betta will need atleast a gallon container to live in. Many of the betta containers you see at the stores are way to small for your betta. Sitting at the store in a small cup for weeks is bad enough, he shouldn&apos;t have to live in one for his whole life though. In anything under a gallon your bettas water will have to be changed everyday to every other day, which can be very stressful on your betta. Not to mention if you don&apos;t change his water often enough that can also stress him out. In small containers ammonia builds up very rapidly, which can lead to a whole list of diseases and can even burn your betta. As reference for your container a one gallon container should be changed every 3 days. But every betta is different so I suggest getting.... An ammonia test kit. Test everyday from the first day you change his water, when you get an ammonia reading then you know how many days you can go inbetween water changes. Adding plants such as Java Moss or Java Fern, which are low light plants, help keep the water cleaner inbetween changes. Bettas can tolerate pH levels from 6.4 to 7.4 but would much rather have it between 6.8 and 7.0. Some people use bottled spring water. I wouldn&apos;t recommend doing this unless you know for sure your always going to have some on hand. The bottled water&apos;s pH is more then likely different from your tap water pH, and everytime you switch between the two you are putting more stress on your betta because he has to adjust to the new pH. If you live in the city then you will also need to get a water conditioner that removes chlorine and chloramines. These can be deadly to your betta. Most people also prefer to age their water for atleast 24 hours. This helps to get the extra oxygen out from running it from the tap. The bubbles from unaged water can result in gill burn if they get on your betta. \u00a0 Let&apos;s not forget that your Betta is a Tropical fish. Bettas prefer temperatures between 78 and 82 degrees. The will tolerate temps as low as 70 but I would make sure to have my temperature higher then that. Some won&apos;t mind it in the 70&apos;s but some get lethargic and stressed being in that cool of waters. If your house stays cool I would recommend getting a Junior Heater which means you will have to upgrade your bettas home to atleast a 2 gallon, but it&apos;s worth it and I&apos;m sure your betta won&apos;t be complaining. \u00a0 Now that we have down the water basics, what will you feed your betta? You can find many varieties of betta pellets, flakes and treats. A varied diet is always best! Most bettas will only eat the pellets and not even touch the flakes, and some are just the opposite. A staple diet of pellets or flakes will suffice. But your betta does get tired of eating the same old thing all the time. You can feed your betta freeze dried bloodworms or freeze dried brine shrimp, or a wide variety of frozen foods that include both above, plus beefheart, tubifex worms or baby brine shrimp. Then there is the list of live foods such as black worms, white worms, baby brine shrimp, tubifex worms or mosquito larvae. These should only be given on a treat basis, about 2-3 times a week. \u00a0 So you want to decorate your betta bowl? Well that&apos;s just fine! Your betta will thank you. There is a world of possibility of how you can decorate, just stay away from plastic plants! Bettas long frilly fins hang and tear very easily, esp. on sharp plastic edges. Only have silk or live plants. Try to stay away from adding an sort of seashells, which can raise the pH and make the water hard. As stated before Java Moss or Java Ferns would be perfect for your betta. These plants require no special lighting and reproduce quite quickly. Plus your betta&apos;s love to nap, so why not give them a comfy bed of java moss or a nice leave to use as a hammock? \u00a0 Following the above instructions will help you and your betta enjoy it&apos;s life, full of energy and spunk!

The first four points I\u2019ve written here contain information that you probably know if you have read anything about this film (and you certainly know if you\u2019ve seen the film). So if you want, you can skip past these first four points and go straight to some points that are a little more unique. The film is based on a Marvel comic and has been compared favorably with other comic book films; even the other comic \u2018Man\u2019 films (\u2018Super\u2019, \u2018Bat\u2019 and \u2018Spider\u2019.) But an interesting difference between the hero in this film and the heroes of \u2018Superman\u2019, \u2018Batman\u2019 and \u2018Spiderman\u2019 is that those heroes make great effort to avoid deadly force. Batman has a policy against using guns. Superman uses his great powers to jail rather than kill villains almost without fail. Spiderman\u2019s villains in the films die because of their own hubris rather than at Spidey\u2019s hand (or web or whatever). Iron Man has guns and missiles built into his suit that are intended to kill people, and he does that very thing. Keep that in mind if you\u2019re thinking of taking the young\u2019uns. (If you want to know how I think it compares to the other superhero \u2018Man\u2019 films, I\u2019ve ranked them below.) The cast is great. Gwyneth Paltrow takes the role of Pepper Potts, the loyal assistant that could have been a clich\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and an offense to feminists, and makes the character into a charming blend of strength and vulnerability. Jeff Bridges ably projects ironic menace as Obadiah Stane. Terrance Howard is okay, but not nearly as interesting as he has been in other films. But it\u2019s all about the guy who plays Tony Stark, the man who becomes Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in the film. He is the single best reason to buy a ticket. It\u2019s fun to see a forty-something year old not so chiseled hero (the power is in the suit). Downey plays the billionaire playboy munitions manufacturer as someone whose top concern is amusing himself. Downey has given similar top drawer performances in such films as last year\u2019s Zodiac or A Scanner Darkly from the year before that. But very few people saw those films. (Super hero films tend to be more popular than docudramas about serial killers or animated dystrophic science fiction.) In real life, Downey has struggled with abuse problems, and it\u2019s a pleasure to see him in such an entertaining breakout role. This movie is making a lot of money. It made one hundred million dollars in its opening weekend alone. There has been a drought of exciting popcorn films in theaters, and many are rushing to see a film they hear is just plain fun. You might want to stay past the final credits to get a hint of sequels to come. As I said, all this has been written about before. So what can I add for the church newsletter? How about a ridiculous comparison to Scripture? Why not? If you can\u2019t write silly about a super hero film, what can you write silly about? The first suit worn by Tony Stark in the film is built by the character in a cave in Afghanistan. He is being held hostage by terrorists who want him to build a missile system. He uses the materials system to build a mechanical suit that allows him to escape. When he returns home, he builds a bigger and better suit. So let\u2019s take a look at how the armor of Iron Man compares to the armor of God described in Ephesians chapter 6. 10Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil&apos;s schemes. 12For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Right off the bat, we get a big contrast between the two suits. Iron Man\u2019s armor is used to protect against flesh and blood. Though for PC reasons the film does not label the terrorists in the film as Muslim, they are quite obviously modeled after the Taliban. Tony Stark has no compunction about killing with bullets those who would kill him or innocent bystanders. Paul makes it clear in this passage that our real enemies are not other people. Those people that seem to be our enemies have been deceived by the powers of darkness, and we must do our best to show love to people who strike out against us. (Note I am not saying here there is not a role for police officers and soldiers to use force to protect the innocent.) But we need to pray for and love those who ridicule Jesus Christ and His teaching, and not treat them as enemies. Paul makes it clear that there are real evil spiritual forces in the world, Satan and his minions along with destructive philosophies and teaching. That is where the battle lies for a Christian. 14Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, In the film, Stark runs a munitions company. When captured by terrorists he sees that they are using his company\u2019s weapons for nefarious ends. He then pursues the truth about how they obtained his weapons, knowing the exposure of the truth may have a great financial cost. As Christians, we need to pursue the truth, even if it is costly. As the film begins, Tony Stark is definitely not a righteous man. We see he is a gambler, a heavy drinker and sexually promiscuous. But when a character in the film sacrifices his life for Stark, we see Stark realize that he should not live his life so selfishly. Because someone gave His life for us, we need to pursue righteousness. 15and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. Stark\u2019s feet are equipped with rocket packs. But I\u2019d argue that God\u2019s Spirit can get us where we need to go to share His good news faster and farther. 16In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Stark\u2019s whole suit is a shield. His basic power is invulnerability. We have the armor of God, which will not necessarily protect us from illness or pain or poverty. But if we trust Him, it will protect us from the flaming arrows of the evil one that would have eternal, damning consequences. 17Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Stark uses all kinds of offensive weaponry. He has all kinds of guns and missiles and his very armor acts as a weapon. But the sword is the only offensive weapon in God\u2019s arsenal. We need to get to know the Bible, the Word of God, well. It\u2019s the only weapon of God we have. And all we need. 18And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints. Iron Man pretty much fights alone. We, like a real army, need the support of others. We need the prayers of our fellow believers. And we need to pray for them. The kid in me watches Iron Man and thinks, \u201cI wish I had a suit like that.\u201d But the Spirit in me says, \u201cYou have something better.\u201d (Iron Man is rated PG-13 for violence, sensuality and language.) [For the geeks: my rating of how Iron Man compares to the Superman, Batman and Spiderman films. On par with Superman, not at good as Superman II, but far better than the horrible Superman III and Superman IV and the mediocre Superman Returns. Better than Batman (1966), Batman (1989) and far better than the wretched Batman Returns, Batman Forever and worst of all Batman and Robin. Its not as good as Batman Begins and the jury\u2019s still out on The Dark Knight with Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, which will be released July 18th.

Russell&apos;s previous work includes a dark comedy about a young man who sleeps with his mother (Spanking the Monkey) and a screwball comedy about a neurotic New Yorker searching for his birth parents (Flirting with Disaster). So, you might think that the rugged horrors of war would not be this director&apos;s proper theater of operations. In fact, it is precisely Russell&apos;s black, suspicious vision of modern American behavior that not only makes him suitable for the genre but makes his latest, Three Kings, far more complex than a typical war movie. Russell&apos;s already shown that relationships between regular people are muddled messes fueled by deception and selfishness, so exploring the mucked-up attempted accords between antagonist countries is actually just an extension of his earlier themes--especially considering his chaotic, amoral target, the Gulf War. The film begins with a startling, somewhat droll image: Army Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) shoots an armed man standing atop a dune in the distance. Before popping him, Barlow is unsure what to do and continually asks his comrades for suggestions. See, it&apos;s March 1991, Saddam Hussein has been kicked out of Kuwait, and a cease-fire has been declared between the Allied forces and Iraq. Russell introduces us to the conflict in a detached, nearly farcical manner; confusion and questionable ethics give way to victory being celebrated by volunteer soldiers who&apos;ve never tasted combat (&quot;I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d get to see anyone get shot in this war,&quot; Barlow&apos;s buddy exclaims).

Case, the manufacturer of tractors and other construction machinery, and partner IBM. Material Requirements Planning or MRP is the initial effort. This application software serves as the method for planning and scheduling materials for complex manufactured products. 1970s.- Initial MRP solutions are big, clumsy and expensive. They require a large technical staff to support the mainframe computers on which they run. 1972.- Five engineers in Mannheim, Germany begin the company, SAP (Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung). The purpose in creating SAP is to produce and market standard software for integrated business solutions. 1975.-Richard Lawson, Bill Lawson, and business partner, John Cerullo begins Lawson Software. The founders see the need for pre-packaged enterprise technology solutions as an alternative to customized business software applications. 1976.-In the manufacturing industry, MRP (Material Requirements Planning) becomes the fundamental concept used in production management and control. 1977.-Jack Thompson, Dan Gregory, and Ed McVaney form JD Edwards. Each founder takes part of their name to create the company moniker. Larry Ellison begins Oracle Corporation. 1978.-Jan Baan begins The Baan Corporation to provide financial and administrative consulting services. 1979.- Oracle offers the first commercial SQL relational database management system. 1980.- JD Edwards begins focusing on the IBM System/38 in the early 1980s. MRP (Manufacturing Resources Planning) evolves into MRP-II as a more accessible extension to shop floor and distribution management activities. 1981.- Baan begins to use UNIX as their main operating system. 1982.- Baan delivers its first software product. JD Edwards focuses on the IBM System/38. 1983.- Oracle offers both a VAX mode database as well as a database written entirely in C (for portability). 1984.- Baan shifts the focus of their development to manufacturing. 1985.- JD Edwards is recognized as an industry-leading supplier of applications software for the highly successful IBM AS/400 computer, a direct descendant of the System/38. 1987.- PeopleSoft is founded by Dave Duffield and Ken Morris in 1987. 1988.- PeopleSoft&apos;s Human Resource Management System (HRMS) is developed. 1990.- Baan software is rolled out to 35 countries through indirect sales channels. The term ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is coined in the early 1990&apos;s when MRP-II is extended to cover areas like Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, and Project Management. 1991.- PeopleSoft sets up offices in Canada. This leads the way to their presence in Europe, Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and the Pacific Rim. 1995.- Baan grows to more than 1,800 customers worldwide and over 1,000 employees. 1999.- JD Edwards has more than 4,700 customers with sites in over 100 countries. Oracle has 41,000 customers worldwide (16,000 U.S.). PeopleSoft software is used by more than 50 percent of the human resources market. SAP is the world&apos;s largest inter-enterprise software company and the world&apos;s fourth largest independent software supplier overall. SAP employs over 20,500 people in more than 50 countries.

Discover for yourself the profound beauty of Torah life, the celebration of the biblical Sabbath and the appreciation of Gods Holy Feast Days.

Aboard the Pilar, now a Q-Ship, Hemingway&apos;s crew was charged with sinking German submarines threatening shipping off the coasts of Cuba and the United States. After the FBI took over Caribbean counter-espionage, he went to Europe as a war correspondent for Collier&apos;s magazine. There Hemingway observed the D-Day landings from an LCVP (landing craft), although he was not allowed to go ashore. He later became angry that his wife, Martha Gellhorn \u2014 by then, more a rival war correspondent than a wife \u2014 had managed to get ashore in the early hours of June 7 dressed as a nurse, after she had crossed the Atlantic to England in a ship loaded with explosives. Hemingway acted as an unofficial liaison officer at Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet, and afterwards formed his own partisan group which, as he later wrote, took part in the liberation of Paris. Although this claim has been challenged by many historians, he was nevertheless unquestionably on the scene. It has also been purported that while traveling to the front he threw a hand grenade into a basement room full of German field grade officers despite his official non-combatant role. After the war, Hemingway started work on The Garden of Eden, which was never finished and would be published posthumously in a much-abridged form in 1986. At one stage, he planned a major trilogy which was to comprise &quot;The Sea When Young&quot;, &quot;The Sea When Absent&quot; and &quot;The Sea in Being&quot; (the latter eventually published in 1952 as The Old Man and the Sea). He spent time in a small Italian town called Acciaroli (located approximately 136 km south of Naples). There was also a &quot;Sea-Chase&quot; story; three of these pieces were edited and stuck together as the posthumously-published novel Islands in the Stream (1970). Newly divorced from Gellhorn after four contentious years, Hemingway married war correspondent Mary Welsh Hemingway, whom he had met overseas in 1944. He returned to Cuba, and in 1945 at the Soviet Embassy became public witness to the Rolando Masferrer schism within the Cuban communist party (Garc\u00eda Montes, and Alonso \u00c1vila, 1970 p. 362). Hemingway&apos;s first novel after For Whom the Bell Tolls was Across the River and into the Trees (1950), set in post-World War II Venice. He derived the title from the last words of American Civil War Confederate General Stonewall Jackson. Enamored of a young Italian girl ( Adriana Ivancich) at the time, Hemingway wrote Across the River and into the Trees as a romance between a war-weary Colonel Cantwell (based on his friend, then Colonel Charles Lanham) and the young Renata (clearly based on Adriana; &quot;Renata&quot; has an assonance with &quot;rinata&quot;, meaning &quot;reborn&quot; in Italian). The novel received largely bad reviews, many of which accused Hemingway of tastelessness, stylistic ineptitude, and sentimentality; however this criticism was not shared by all critics.", "After the war, Hemingway started work on The Garden of Eden, which was never finished and would be published posthumously in much-abridged form in 1986.

After work I head downtown to the Baton Rouge shelter which is housed in the convention center. Baton Rouge is different than Kelly. In thinking back I think the way it seemed then was that Baton Rouge was a place to escape to and San Antonio was a place to start over from. There was much less hope in this place and more a sense of futility with the system, the rules and the attitudes that governed these displaced people. FEMA and the Red Cross disappeared at 5:00 and left 4,000 evacuees in the hands of volunteers and the National Guard - not the Louisiana Guard because they were in Iraq. We did the best we could for people who stayed in their homes hoping the flood waters would recede; or for those who ran out of cash and had to move out of hotels in Houston and Shreveport; and those who had been living in their cars. The line of people checking in was endless. One young couple had been living in their car and had returned to Baton Rouge to try to pick up paychecks. It&apos;s amazing what happens when there are no phones, you have no home and you are out of money. As I checked them in the woman asked if there was a chance we could find a stroller since she had been carrying her child everywhere for a week. I went to the supply area and found one. And, I found a teddy bear too. When I returned with the blankets, cots, stroller, teddy bear and MREs the woman cried in gratitude or relief. I found them a quiet corner to set up their temporary home. These are the points of light I remember, when my small actions were received with gratitude and I felt like I was really doing some good. I was surprised at the ungraciousness of the people of Baton Rouge toward their own State&apos;s displaced people. I guess I might feel different if my Ohio city doubled in size overnight and every person was unemployed and looking for a rest room. After I left the shelter for the night, I went to five ATMs before I found one with money and to three or four stores before I found one with linens and pillows. No grocery store had ice or bottled water. Baton Rouge was under siege mentality and the people acted like it!"], "triple": ["Baton Rouge", "is different than", "Kelly"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": null, "subject": "Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana"}, "_id": 9886}

Notches and grooves appear on one or both sides of a foundation-line [druim]. Each letter was named for a different tree, e.g. a = ailm [pine], b = beithe [birch], etc., Designations for the letters q, v, and z, which are not used in Irish, support the now widely accepted interpretation of ogham as an expression of Irish through the Latin alphabet. The current view displaces many colourful speculations on ogham&apos;s origin: runic alphabet of Scandinavia, Chalcidic Creek, northern Etruscan, etc. Ogham inscriptions date primarily from the 4th to 5th centuries and are found mainly on standing stones; evidence for inscriptions in wood exists, but examples do not survive. The greatest concentration of surviving ogham inscriptions is in southern Ireland; a 1945 survey found 121 in Kerry and 81 in Co. Cork, while others are scattered throughout Ireland, Great Britain, and the Isle of Man, with five in Cornwall, about thirty in Scotland, mainly in &apos;Pictish&apos; areas, and more than forty in Wales. South Wales was an area of extensive settlement from southern Ireland, including the migration of the De&apos;isi. Ogham was also used for Pictish. In Wales, ogham inscriptions have both Irish and Brythonic-Latin adjacent inscriptions. Most ogham inscriptions are very short, usually consisting of a name and a patronymic in the genitive case. They are of linguistic rather than literary interest, because they show an older state of the Irish language than found in any other written sources. Many appear to be memorials to the dead, while others mark the border between two lands. Although the knowledge of ogham was never lost to scholars (at least one 19th-cent. grave-marker uses it), the notion that ogham was employed for occult or magical purposes dogs critical commentary. As late as the 1930s the eminent archaeologist R. A. S. Macalister proposed that ogham was part of the secret language of &apos;druidic freemasonry&apos;. Se\u00e1n O&apos;Boyle suggested (1980) that the key to explaining ogham is harp notation. The god of rhetoric and eloquence, Ogma, is an attributed creator; his name and the word appear to be philologically related. See..

Emmanuel Levinas has read Heidegger, and was even a Heideggerian reader of Husserl (before the war).

On the other hand, he criticizes Heidegger, not for accessory aspects or subsidiary conclusions, but concerning the very heart of what the \u2018thought of Being\u2019 implies in its \u2018ethical\u2019 dimension.25 Briefly put, Levinas holds that the theme of the alterity of Being is in Heidegger a new and definitive way of giving more importance to the theoretical sphere than to the ethical; for Levinas it is a way of encouraging contemplation, be it that of withdrawal, rather than encouraging an opening onto the unique beyond Being which the demand of the other, in all its urgency, provokes. For Levinas, what is at stake is a critique of Heidegger\u2019s \u2018crossed out\u2019 ontology, which ontology figures the reign of ontology in general, the reign of light, and of knowledge. This critique is undertaken in the name of the irreducible priority of the \u2018ethical relation\u2019, a priority which according to Levinas must acknowledge the doctrine of intelligibility. Such a critique of Heideggerianism\u2014which exists and whose texts cannot be recommended often enough for those who wish to experiment, texts which are much more beautiful and convincing than our summary has suggested\u2014obviously casts light on this problem. The way in which the Heideggerian approach as an ontological approach is the concealment or the refusal of \u2018ethical dependence\u2019, of the \u2018non-condition of the hostage\u2019 as Levinas calls it, allows us to understand the following: how Heidegger could not fail, from within his philosophy, to commit his potential \u2018mistake\u2019\u2014and this in an affair the stake of which was precisely that of ethical pertinence, justice, the prohibition of murder, the relation to the demand of the face."], "triple": ["Emmanuel Levinas", "has read", "Heidegger"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Martin_Heidegger", "subject": "Emmanuel_Levinas"}, "_id": 32691}

He teaches and studies philosophy at Fordham University, where he is a graduate student. Zane and his wife, Angela, live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. If youve browsed this website, youve most likely come across the frequent use of the term the Other. You may have wondered, What does it mean? Where does it come from? The term has been developed by European philosophers and came into usage through the work of Jewish/French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995), an extremely influential, some might call quintessentially post-modern, thinker. Levinas fought in World War II, taught philosophy at the University of Paris, and is also known for his Talmudic scholarship. Levinas extensive writings are permeated with this term, but are notoriously hard to digest. Here is a short overview of the meaning of the term. According to Levinas, when we encounter another human being, the face of the Other speaks to us and ethically obligates us. The innovative nature of this claim becomes more evident when Levinas thought is compared with the thought of a Frenchman that is more familiar to many people--Rene Descartes. In his quest for absolute certainty, Descartes infamously describes his method of radical doubt. One must doubt everythingthe beliefs inherited from ones parents and teacher, and even ones own senses!\u00a0 After demolishing this shaky edifice of beliefs, one can reconstruct a stable building of knowledge built from indubitable facts. What is the indubitable and, therefore, foundational fact? Descartes claims that he cannot doubt the fact that he is doubting. I think, therefore I am, he purportedly claimed. Starting from this point, one begins to work ones way to other certain facts. Following Descartes lead, many philosophers seem to think that the primary task of philosophy is an epistemological or metaphysical one. What we desire most is absolutely certain knowledge. How do I know that the external world and others exist? (Believe it or not, philosophers have spent much time and energy trying to answer this question!) With the proper method of acquiring knowledge (epistemology), one can ascertain what is real (metaphysics). Ethics, or practical philosophy, is a secondary concern; knowing (epistemology) and reality (metaphysics) take priority. Once we know what is real, we can find out what is good and right. Furthermore, figuring out the good and right is reduced to the derivation of principles or maxims from abstractions.\u00a0 In contrast to this, Levinas treats ethics as a &quot;first philosophy.&quot;\u00a0 Ac "], "triple": ["Levinas", "fought in", "World War II"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "World War II", "subject": "Philosophy"}, "_id": 62948}

In the past, Springsteen albums have had titles that sounded like his best songs: epic, elemental and evocative. Compared to Darkness on the Edge of Town or Devils &amp; Dust, Magic seemed to conjure up not so much a runaway American dream as an easy-listening soft-rock radio station. Happily our fears were unfounded: Magic is the finest Springsteen album since Tunnel of Love, which was released 20 years ago. I recall the visceral impact that listening to Tunnel of Love had on me at the age of 16; it inspired me to better understand myself and my place in the world. Twenty years on and I am only two years younger than Bruce was when he released that album - and his music offers a different kind of inspiration. Bruce Springsteen is 58 now, and this week began a world tour with the E Street Band - a group of musicians that has remained largely unchanged for more than 30 years. But while musically Springsteen might sound like he is revisiting his glory days, lyrically the album is the work of someone utterly engaged with the present day - his songs are meditations on an America that he believes has strayed from its ideals. It is easy to repeat and repackage the past (ask the Rolling Stones), but far harder to remain relevant in the present. To enjoy a career that stretches more than three decades is remarkable enough, but to be producing work 35 years into that career that stands comparison with your best records is truly astonishing. In these days of instant pop stars and disposable rock heroes Springsteen is in a league of his own, which is perhaps why when he was asked some years ago to nominate the greatest living American, he did not choose a musician, he opted instead for the author Philip Roth. \u201cTo be in his 60s, making work that is so strong,\u201d he enthused, \u201cso full of revelations about love and emotional pain, that\u2019s the way to live your artistic life. Sustain, sustain, sustain.\u201d Philip Roth is now 74, and his latest novel Exit Ghost is released in the same week as Magic. Like Springsteen, Roth is a son of New Jersey, and both have mined their lives in their work. Like Magic, Exit Ghost revisits the past; it is the latest and last novel to feature Roth\u2019s alter ego Nathan Zuckerman, who first appeared 28 years ago in The Ghost Writer. Both Springsteen and Roth are unfussy writers - what Howard Jacobson has described as \u201clanguage in the service of intelligence, thought wrought to sense\u201d. The sensation of reading Roth at his best reminds me of how it feels to listen to a great Bruce Springsteen song: there is a beguiling simplicity that masks a great truth, there is a respect for the lives and aspirations of ordinary people, and there is a willingness to confront the biggest questions there are. In The Ghost Writer, Nathan Zuckerman meets his literary hero EI Lonoff, who describes his work thus: \u201cI turn sentences around. That\u2019s my life. I write a sentence and then I turn it around. Then I look at it and I turn it around again. Then I have lunch. Then I come back in and write another sentence.\u201d In Thunder Road, on the Born to Run album, Springsteen was similarly casual, singing: \u201cI got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk.\u201d Three decades on and Roth is still turning sentences around and Springsteen is still making his guitar talk - two American masters who, in a culture obsessed with youth and newness, remind us that there are hidden worlds of wisdom that are only illuminated with the passing of time."], "triple": ["Roth", "is a son of", "New Jersey"], "kbp_info": [["PERSON", "per:stateorprovinces_of_residence", "LOCATION"]], "entity_linking": {"object": "New_Jersey", "subject": "Author"}, "_id": 92623}

Nothing I suspect has been so valuable to society in communicating the joys and rewards of an art form which has become so truly and splendidly national&apos;. Nevertheless it was an exciting day for Howard when he realised the Trust had produced its first rebel and he constantly also supported the work of rival independent choreographers and their companies. The Place today incorporates a 300 seat theatre, re-named as the Robin Howard Dance Theatre in 2001, that presents a year-round programme of British and international dance. In its first phase, 1969-77, it was used for experimental work in music and drama as well as dance, but since 1982 has focused on a single art in its multiplicity of forms. The Place is home to London Contemporary Dance School, attracting students and teachers from around the world. This provides both undergraduate and postgraduate vocational training as well as a research programme in contemporary dance and has up to 170 students from many different countries. Graduates of the School have an impressive track record, including many of the dancers and choreographers who have shaped today&apos;s international dance scene. It also houses a range of learning and access programmes including classes in the evenings and at weekends, catering for people of all ages, with varied interests and abilities. The Place has provided a home for major national and internationally acclaimed companies; until 1994 it was the base for London Contemporary Dance Theatre and subsequently the Richard Alston Dance Company, as well as many independent companies, resident choreographers and associate artists. Since 1991 it has also provided services for the independent dance sector, including information, advice, choreographic opportunities and a world-class dance video library. No team of founders could have been more respected or loved than those who built The Place. Howard and his colleagues always recognised the need to regenerate enthusiasm for a project. Plans, he noted would change, but the Trust&apos;s principles should remain constant.

No amount of apologetic bowing is going to make up for that. When I first read about Banzai Skydiving, I was dubious. Some things are too fucked up even for the Japanese. But it&apos;s even in the Guinness Book of World Records, 2007 edition, page 95. It&apos;s not listed under &quot;Suicide, funniest way to commit,&quot; although it should be. No, they measure how much time jumpers are willing to wait before they go after their chute. The world record is apparently held by Yasuhiro Kubo, who waited a courageous 50 seconds before leaping after his parachute. After he returned to earth, Kubo was quoted as saying &quot;I fly like mighty dragon with nothing but the wind of my ancestors to protect me. Drink Kirin Beer.&quot; Buzkashi (Afghanistan) But when it comes to dangerous sports, Japan has nothing on Afghanistan. The country has always been a shithole, even well before it was bombed into the Stone Age by the forces of justice. But there was once a time when a young Afghani guy could get his adrenaline on, playing a horseback sport called buzkashi. In buzkashi, a player&apos;s goal is to grab the carcass of a headless goat and then get it clear of the other players and pitch it across a goal line or into a target circle. Well, that doesn&apos;t sound so...wait a minute, headless goat? I&apos;ll admit, some Western sports equipment comes from dead animals, but there&apos;s almost no chance a football is going to squirt intestines at you during a game. But what&apos;s even worse than the decomposing maggot farm of a game ball are the rules governing contact between players. As you may have guessed, Afghanistan really doesn&apos;t have a governing body responsible for enforcing buzkashi penalties. As a result, pretty much anything goes in your mission to drag that goat carcass across the goal line According to my sources, if you&apos;re lucky enough to take possession of the ball, you can expect hordes of horse-mounted maniacs to try and kill you. This is not a rugged sports analogy; they will literally try to end your life. Players end up with shattered faces, broken bones, and worst of all, hurt feelings. Plus, I&apos;m pretty sure an American artillery division peppers the field during play. Suddenly, NFL linemen don&apos;t seem so tough, do they? Extreme Ironing (England) Our foreign tour winds up in England, the country that brought such riveting spectacles as cricket and the monarchy. Most British people are exhilarated by things like bird calls and oddly-shaped pieces of toast. That&apos;s why it&apos;s no surprise that their contribution to adrenaline sports is something called &quot;Extreme Ironing.&quot; Yes, such a thing actually exists. Obviously, it caters to the British sense of whimsy and eccentricity (read: gay). As with most British things, it&apos;s tough to tell just how firmly tongue is planted in cheek. On the one hand, we&apos;re talking about actual, honest-to-goodness ironing. On the other hand, people are doing it in very real, very dangerous locations. Look, I appreciate the fact that Britain gets a few chuckles by juxtaposing serious and goofy things. That was pretty much the whole premise of Monty Python, before nerds made a religion out of quoting it. But extreme ironing just doesn&apos;t have the comedic staying power of, say, Benny Hill. One day, someone&apos;s going to get killed while pressing a shirt on Mt. Everest, and the bastards at General Electric won&apos;t care. All nations, with the possible exception of Switzerland, can lay claim to some retardedly dangerous activity. Whether you&apos;re ice-climbing in Russia, hang-gliding in Australia, or just tempting fate by driving in South Africa, every corner of the globe offers new and innovative ways to maim yourself. What point do we think we are making by doing these things? The way I figure it, as long as women continue to be insatiable maelstroms of sexual energy, there will always be men willing to risk their lives to impress them. Cavemen probably drenched themselves in barbeque sauce and wrestled sabre-tooth tigers. And in the future, I won&apos;t be surprised to see full-contact rocket lava-boarding. But as long as I can watch it on ESPN8, I won&apos;t complain.

Japan is often described as a part of Asia, but also sometimes as a member of the West. Japan may not belong to anywhere but have its own category of civilisation as Huntington suggests in his article of the Clash of Civilizations? (1993). The Japanese self-identity is even more ambiguous as if the country is staggering between the West and Asia (Holloway 1991: 6).

The conference was likely to be held in Tokyo as before, but the late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi decided to choose Okinawa as the main meeting place. Okinawa, formally known as Ryukyu, has a different background from the mainland Japan. The Ryukyu Kingdom historically functioned as a base of trade and communication between Japan and China and its surrounding nations. Today, Okinawa is often described as an entrance to Asia from Japan as the message of a memorial in Okinawa says here Japan ends and Asia begins, and here Asia ends and Japan begins (Sakamoto 2000). Therefore, the decision by Obuchi to have the main meetings of the G8 summit conference in Okinawa was important in the Japanese politics, suggesting the governments willing to make much of Asia.", "As we can see, Japan has been swayed between the great powers such as China, Europe, and the U.S. As Saeki points out, the majority of Japanese tend to think of the core civilisations and cultures of the world as things that always exist elsewhere, distant models that the Japanese must first of all humbly strive to emulate (1999). Therefore, Japan learned from the Chinese civilisation in the early stage of the history, then experienced modernisation in the Meiji Restoration of 1868 by learning from the West, and finally, developed on the model of the U.S. after WWII. So Japan, throughout the history, has not been represented clearly either within the country or outside.

Only one country at the outbreak of World War II had the industrial and agricultural capacity as well as the resource base to wage world war and that was the United States which had no desire to wage another world war. The Soviet Union had significantly expanded the Russian industrial base, but weakened the country&apos;s agricultural base through enducung the Ukranian famine and collectivzing agriculture. Like the United States, the Soviets posessed enormous natural resources and like Germany, they has desisns on neigboring countries. Britain was less well situated. It had a substantial industrial and scientific base, but except for coal and iron, limited domestic resources. And it had to import large quantities of food. Those resources, however, existed in the Empire and overseas trading partners like America. The Royal Navy existed to ensure access to those resources in time of War, but had been allowed to decline in strength during the inter-War period. France was better situated in terms of Britain as to food production and as a result of its navy and alliance with Britain was guaranteed access to needed raw materials in its colonies and trading partners. The Axis powers were less favorably positioned for War in ters of raw materials. Germany was an important industrial and scientific power, but could neither feed itself nor possessed the strategic resources needed for industrial world war. The one critical resource Germany possessed in abundance was coal. Other important strategic materials would have to be imported. This made Germany vulnerable to blockade and as in World War I, Germany did not have the naval power to contest a Royal Navy blockade. Germany was particularly defecient in access to petroleum, a necesity for the modern mechnized war in planned to wage. Germany&apos;s answer to this was a sunthetic petroleum industry, but this did not even meet the country&apos;s need in peace time. The limited resource base was why Hitler in his strategic thinking from a very early stage looked east to the copious resources of the Soviet Union--resources that were not subject to a Royal Navy blockade.

Iran is working on nukes, Iran is working on nukes, even though the International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is not working on nukes. Now we are told the Israelis have created a mock version of Iran\u2019s Natanz uranium enrichment plant in order to practice assaults on the facility. Ha\u2019aretz reports \u2018Israel would use F-15 fighter planes and its air force\u2019s elite Shaldag [Kingfisher] unit in the attack.\u2019 For months now, Israel has sent the same message over and over: Iran is close to finishing construction on a nuke (call it the George Bush effect; there is no evidence Iran is building a nuke; uranium enrichment is not the same thing as building a nuke, thus Israel is exaggerating and lying as a pretext to attack). Another part of the message is that Iran cannot be trusted, it is a nation of crazed Muslims who want to kill all Israelis. In fact, if Israel has said anything consistently, it is that every single Arab and Muslim wants to kill Jews and push them into the sea. Last year it was figured the IAEA would be used as a cudgel to beat Iran into submission and impose Iraq-like sanctions on the country. But over the last few months the US and Israel have consistently beat the war drums. Every few weeks Israel comes out with another Iran nuke story. \u2018Heading off Iran\u2019s attempt to attain nuclear capability is one of the Mossad\u2019s main missions, and the foreign media is one of the most important instruments utilized in this effort,\u2019 Aluf Benn wrote in Haaretz in 2003. \u2018Mossad agents supply foreign journalists with information about Iran\u2019s nuclear efforts; such foreign reports, the Mossad expects, support the international campaign to thwart Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\u2019 Lately, however, Iran has been telling the US and Israel to go suck an egg-it will not stop uranium enrichment, it feels uranium enrichment is in its national interest and Israel and the United States should butt out. Now we have Mossad agents pulling fire alarms, telling the world they are actually practicing bombing Iran. Mossad, the Likudite faction in Israel, and the Strausscons in the United States want you to know they plan to bomb Iran very soon. If they do this all hell will break loose. Natanz is not Ain Saheb. Iran is not Syria. The Likudites and the Strausscons realize that any attack on Iran would solidify the position of the fundie mullahs. \u2018Tehran, experts expected, could move Iraqi Shiite groups to launch attacks against US occupation forces, already facing a hellish situation amid a bubbling cauldron of chaos and anarchy in the war-scarred country. They can also provide these groups with human and logistic support,\u2019 Islam Online reported last year. \u2018The Islamic Republic could also use Southern Lebanon, controlled by the Lebanese resistance movement Hizbullah which can not stand neutral regarding an Israeli attack on Iran.\u2019 As the experts cited by Islam Online see it, this \u2018could spill over to a Syrian-Israeli confrontation.\u2019 Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah-three targets at the top of the Likudite-Strausscon mafia hit list. Israel wants to start a war-the Strausscons call it World War IV-and get the United States to fight it. The NED and Republican NGO engineered \u2018Cedar revolution\u2019 in Lebanon will of course not pan out-not if the Muslim majority in Lebanon, who know a scam when they see it, have anything to say about it-and even if they do manage to get \u2018moderates\u2019 (Christian Maronite fascists) back in power, this will not put an end to Hezbollah who understand the true nature of the Israeli colonialist settler state: Israel hungers for southern Lebanon, its land and water, and it will stop at nothing to pitch Lebanon-indeed, the entire region-into war and chaos. Fragmenting and balkanizing the Arab and Muslim world remains a long-held Zionist dream. In the propaganda campaign for total war (and the Haaretz item above is simply the latest element of this on-going propaganda blitz) we are told \u2018Israel is worried that a preemptive strike against Iran could provoke \u2018a ferocious response,\u2019 including attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets abroad, as well as Lebanese-based rocket attacks on northern Israel,\u2019 which is of course precisely what the Likudites want, especially among the Shia in southern Iraq who will undoubtedly be agitated if Israel attacks Iran. A Shia jihad declared against the infidels is exactly what the Likudites and the Strausscons want. It will provide an excuse for even more military action on the part of the United States, possibly in Iran and Lebanon as well as in Iraq. Of course, this is completely insane, since the US cannot contain a couple hundred thousand Sunni resistance fighters in Iraq let alone an influx of possibly millions of Muslims from Iran. For the Strausscons and Israelis, bombing Iran is a way to up the ante and set in motion a series of events that will result in total war. In order to for the American people to find the \u2019stomach\u2019 (as the Strausscon godfather, Norman Podhoretz, deems it) for total war, a few terrorist events closer to home may be required. Mossad has plenty of experience pulling off such events. Israel, however, did not learn its lesson in southern Lebanon. \u2018The increasingly effective operational capabilities of the resistance prove once more that it takes a small group of determined fighters armed with light arms and \u2018weighty\u2019 faith to expose zionist pretentious claims to invincibility and omnipotence as nothing short of a hollow myth,\u2019 Khalil Osman wrote in 1998, before Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Lebanon. It will be a \u2018hollow myth\u2019 that drives the Likudite-Strausscon war against the Arab and Muslim Middle East. It is no longer 1920 and the Arabs are not so easily divided and ruled. If Israel attacks Iran, a Hezbollah-styled resistance will spread across the Middle East and may even join together with the Sunni resistance in Iraq, even though the corporate media loves to tell us the Shia want nothing more than to put down the Sunni rebellion.

It is essential that we do whatever is possible to prevent such a disaster. We would like to clear a number of misunderstandings about Iran. As a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), Iran asserts its right under Article IV of the NPT to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The announcement last week of a nuclear breakthrough is part of this right and is intended for peaceful purposes. Iran has complied with Articles I and II of the NPT not to acquire nuclear weapons, and Article III, where it accepts full safeguards. It has signed the NPT additional protocol and has allowed intrusive inspections beyond what is required by compliance with the NPT. Numerous inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency have failed to provide any shred of evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons programme. Iran has repeatedly announced that it is committed to replace the course of confrontation with good-faith interaction and negotiations, as equal partner, for a peaceful solution to its nuclear issue. It has stated its commitment to non-proliferation and to the elimination of nuclear weapons, and considers nuclear weapons detrimental to its security. It has declared its readiness to abide by its obligations under the NPT and to work for the establishment of a zone free from weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. It has invited the west and the world for cultural and technological collaboration. Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attack and participated in overthrowing the Taliban regime in late 2001. In return, under the pressure of the neoconservatives in the US and their supporters globally, Iran has faced intimidation based on speculations about its intention of producing WMD. For the majority of Iranians in Iran and outside Iran, this hostility towards Iran is about returning Iran to a client state for the benefit of US oil corporations and denying Iran&apos;s rights to research and development for generating electricity in the future, independently. Iran is not a threat in the region or to the world as was suggested by the American Jewish Committee&apos;s full-page &quot;statement&quot; in the Financial Times recently. Iran is surrounded by India, Pakistan, Russia and Israel, which have nuclear weapons. The US, UK and Israel, which perceive Iran as a threat, themselves possess WMD and refuse to commit to nuclear disarmament. Iranians believe that Israel may well use its nuclear weapons against them. They are all too aware that Israel has refused to sign the NPT and has not allowed the IAEA to inspect its nuclear programme. The only chance the world has of avoiding another disastrous US military adventure in the Middle East is to resolve Iran&apos;s nuclear issue through diplomacy. It is essential that all voices opposed to the devastation of a new war in the Middle East speak out now. We need funds for human needs, not endless wars and conflicts.

BLITZER: Gentlemen, thank you very much for those brief self-introductions. Let\u2019s begin our questioning right now, Tom Fahey of the New Hampshire Union Leader with the first question. MR. FAHEY: Thanks, Wolf. Governor Romney, I wanted to start by asking you a question on which every American has formed an opinion. We\u2019ve lost 3,400 troops; civilian casualties are even higher, and the Iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country. Knowing everything you know right now, was it a mistake for us to invade Iraq? MR. ROMNEY: Well, the question is kind of a non sequitur, if you will, and what I mean by that \u2014 or a null set. And that is that if you\u2019re saying let\u2019s turn back the clock, and Saddam Hussein had opened up his country to IAEA inspectors, and they\u2019d come in and they\u2019d found that there were no weapons of mass destruction, had Saddam Hussein, therefore, not violated United Nations resolutions, we wouldn\u2019t be in the conflict we\u2019re in. But he didn\u2019t do those things, and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in. I supported the president\u2019s decision based on what we knew at that time. I think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down Saddam Hussein. By the way, Harry Reid was wrong. We did not lose the war in Iraq. And that\u2019s not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harm\u2019s way. We did, however, not do a great job after we knocked down Saddam Hussein and won the war to take him down, and his military. And at this stage, the right thing for us to do is to see if we can possibly stabilize the central government in Iraq so that they can have stability and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possible. Not to do that adds an enormous potential risk that the whole region could be embroiled in a regional conflict. MR. BLITZER: Governor, thank you, but the question was, knowing what you know right now \u2014 not what you knew then, what you know right now \u2014 was it a mistake for the United States to invade Iraq? MR. ROMNEY: Well, I answered the question by saying it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a non sequitur, it\u2019s a null set kind of question, because you can go back and say, if we knew then what we know now, by virtue of inspectors having been let in and giving us that information, by virtue of if Saddam Hussein had followed the U.N. resolutions, we wouldn\u2019t be having this \u2014 this discussion. So it\u2019s a hypothetical that I think is an unreasonable hypothetical. And the answer is, we did what we did; we did the right thing based on what we knew at that time. I think we made mistakes following the conduct \u2014 or the collapse of Saddam\u2019s government. MR. BLITZER: Mayor Giuliani, same question to you. Was it \u2014 knowing what you know right now, was it a good decision? MR. GIULIANI: Absolutely the right thing to do. It\u2019s unthinkable that you would leave Saddam Hussein in charge of Iraq and be able to fight the war on terror. And the problem is that we see Iraq in a vacuum. Iraq should not be seen in a vacuum. Iraq is part of the overall terrorist war against the United States. The problem the Democrats make is they\u2019re in denial. That\u2019s why you hear things like you heard in the debate the other night, that, you know, Iran really isn\u2019t dangerous; it\u2019s 10 years away from nuclear weapons. Iran is not 10 years away from nuclear weapons, and the danger to us is not just missiles, the danger to us is a state like Iran handing nuclear weapons over to terrorists, so it has to be seen in that light, and we have to be successful in Iraq. MR. BLITZER: Senator McCain, arguably, going to war is the most important decision a member of the Senate can make. Did you read the National Intelligence Estimate, which included all the caveats, on whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? SEN. MCCAIN: I did not read that particular document. I received hundreds of briefings, tens and hundreds of hours of study and background and information on it. And the fact is, that the sanctions were breaking down. The sanctions were not going to hold. We had a multi-billion-dollar scandal in the form of oil-for-food. The fact is that Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction before on his own people and on his enemies, and if he\u2019d gotten them again, he\u2019d have used them again. That was his commitment and his belief that he was going to, and he did the right thing. The problem was the mismanagement of the conflict. MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Senator Brownback, you\u2019re also a member of the United States Senate. Did you read that classified National Intelligence Estimate? SEN. BROWNBACK: I don\u2019t remember that report. I had a number of briefings. And I held a number of committee hearings. At that time, I was chairing the Middle East Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and we held hearings on this topic and what was taking place and what Saddam was doing. But the issue is, is that we\u2019ve got to put forward now a political plan. And that\u2019s something I\u2019m going to introduce tomorrow, a political plan to create a three-state solution in Iraq \u2014 a Kurdish state, a Sunni state, a Shi\u2019a state \u2014 because Iraq is more three groups held together by exterior forces. MR. BLITZER: All right. SEN. BROWNBACK: And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve lacked, is a political plan to get us moving forward and success. MR. BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Governor Gilmore, let me go to you. You chaired this commission. Do you think it was appropriate that members of Congress would authorize the president to go to war without reading that National Intelligence Estimate? MR. GILMORE: Well, you know, I think the people who are in Congress who are responsible for sending this country to war, with the enormous dangers that it has geopolitically and strategically, ought to read at least that kind of material. I know they get a lot of stuff and they can\u2019t read everything. But you know what, Wolf, I think the true business is this. The interest of the United States is in creating as much stability as possible in the Middle East. There is a very great danger to this country. Our interests in Israel, our interests in energy, and in other ways there\u2019s a giant danger of the Middle East becoming an unstable place. Saddam Hussein was unstable, and so taking him out was good there, but we certainly didn\u2019t anticipate the further instability that was to come out. MR. BLITZER: We\u2019re going to bring all of you in, but I want to go to Scott Spradling of WMUR for the next question. MR. SPRADLING: Thanks, Wolf. Senator McCain, we\u2019ve just spent a few minutes looking back. I\u2019d ask you to look forward now, if you will. Since June 1st, there have been at least 17 confirmed deaths of American soldiers in Iraq. Approximately, 100 U.S. troops are dying there every month. If our top military commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, reports back to Congress this September that the surge hasn\u2019t significantly improved the situation on the ground, what then? SEN. MCCAIN: Well, let me say, first of all, I know how frustrated and saddened all Americans are. This morning I was with the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfeboro, who sacrificed his life, and our hearts and our sympathy goes out to all those who have sacrificed their lives in this conflict. I, one, think this strategy needs to be given a chance to succeed. We haven\u2019t barely gotten the fifth brigade over there, which is part of this strategy. I am convinced that if we fail and we have to withdraw, they will follow us home. It will be a base for al Qaeda, and we will be facing greater challenges and greater sacrifices than that already made by Matthew Stanley and his family. There is no doubt in my mind that this will become a base for terrorism, there will be chaos in the region. And when Senator Clinton says this is Mr. Bush\u2019s war, that this is President Bush\u2019s war \u2014 when President Clinton was in power, I didn\u2019t say that Bosnia, our intervention there was President Clinton\u2019s war. When we intervened in Kosovo, I didn\u2019t say it was President Clinton\u2019s war. MR. BLITZER: Senator. SEN. MCCAIN: What he \u2014 what Senator Clinton doesn\u2019t understand, that presidents don\u2019t lose wars, political parties don\u2019t lose wars; nations lose wars and nations lose the \u2014 have the consequences of failure. MR. BLITZER: Senator. SEN. MCCAIN: We must succeed in this conflict. MR. BLITZER: The question was, if General Petraeus says \u2014 (applause) \u2014 it\u2019s not working so far in September, what do you do then? SEN. MCCAIN: Then you have to examine the options. And I\u2019ll tell you the options. One is the division that Sam described. You would have to divide bedrooms in Baghdad, because Sunni and Shi\u2019a are married to each other. You have 2 million Sunni and 4 million Shi\u2019a living in Baghdad together. You would have to \u2014 you withdraw to the borders and watch genocide take place inside Baghdad. You watch the destabilization of Jordan. You see further jeopardy of Israel because of the threats of Hezbollah and Iranian hegemony in the region. All of the options I could run through with you; my friend, none of them are good. That\u2019s why we must succeed and give it a chance to succeed. MR. BLITZER: All right. Let me bring in Governor Thompson. Go ahead, same question to you. If General Petraeus says it\u2019s not working in September, what should the U.S. do then? MR. THOMPSON: The first thing the president should do is demand the al-Maliki government to vote as to whether or not they want the United States to stay in Iraq. We\u2019ve been there four years. Give the government the responsibility of voting. If they vote yes, how are they going to help us win this war? And if they vote no, we should redeploy our forces outside. Secondly, there are 18 territories in Iraq, geographically defined. Those 18 territories, just like 50 states in America, should elect their state leaders. And if they do so, the Shi\u2019ites will elect Shi\u2019ites, Sunnis will elect Sunnis, Kurds will elect Kurds. And you know something? People will go to those particular territories and you get rid of the civil war, internecine. Number three \u2014 MR. BLITZER: All right, we\u2019ve \u2014 MR. THOMPSON: \u2014 I would like to have the oil revenue proceeds \u2014 very quickly \u2014 MR. BLITZER: All right. MR. THOMPSON: \u2014 oil revenue proceeds split: one third to the federal government, one third to the states, and one third to every man woman and child, and that will get everybody a stake in their country. MR. BLITZER: Let me bring in Congressman Duncan Hunter. Congressman, if it\u2019s not working at that point, how much longer should the United States stay? REP. HUNTER: Well, Wolf, you know, I read that NIE report, and I held the briefings before we made the vote to go in. I\u2019d invited everybody, Democrat and Republican, to get the classified information. And this depends \u2014 the turnover of the security apparatus depends on one thing \u2014 reliable Iraqi forces. You got 129 Iraq battalions; we\u2019ve trained them up. We\u2019ve got a lot of them in the fight. Over the next three to four months, we need to get them all in the fight, get them that combat capability. When they\u2019re combat- hardened, we rotate them in, we displace American heavy combat forces off that battlefield, and Americans come home. And, Wolf \u2014 MR. BLITZER: Thank you. REP. HUNTER: \u2014 I can tell you, as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for the last four years, I have the credentials to leave Iraq the right way. MR. BLITZER: Congressman Ron Paul, how much longer should the United States stay in Iraq? MR. PAUL: The sooner we come home, the better. If they declare there\u2019s no progress in September, we should come home. It was a mistake to go, so it\u2019s a mistake to stay. If we made the wrong diagnosis, we should change the treatment. So we\u2019re not making progress there and we should come home. The weapons weren\u2019t there, and we went in under U.N. resolutions. And our national security was not threatened. We\u2019re more threatened now by staying. (Applause.) MR. BLITZER: Governor Huckabee, do you have confidence in the government of Iraq, the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, that he\u2019s going to do what needs to be done? MR. HUCKABEE: I think there\u2019s some real doubt about that, Wolf. But I want to remind all of us on this stage and the people in the audience that there\u2019s a reason that this is such a struggle. And I think we miss it over here in the West. Today\u2019s the birthday of Ronald Reagan. We all would believe that Ronald Reagan is the one who ended the Cold War, and Ronald Reagan is the one who helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union. But there\u2019s a group of people who don\u2019t believe that, and that\u2019s the Taliban. They believe they brought about the demise of the Soviet Union because of the way they fought in Afghanistan. And what I want to just mention is that it is not the size of the dog in the fight; it is the size of the fight in the dog. And we underestimate, grossly underestimate how fierce this dog and how determined they are to destroy every last one of us. MR. BLITZER: All right. Congressman Tom Tancredo, what do you say? REP. TANCREDO: I\u2019ll tell you this: that if it comes to that point in time that you describe, that the surge \u2014 is apparent that it is not working \u2014 I did not support it. I hope to God it does work. I hope I\u2019m wrong. I hope we pacify Iraq. However, if it is apparent that we cannot, then we have to do and tell the Iraqis the exact same thing that Benjamin Franklin said when he came out of the convention in 1787 and somebody said to him, \u201cDr. Franklin, what have you given us?\u201d And he said, \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201d It is exactly that time and it is exactly that thing that we have to say to the Iraqi government. We have given you this. We bought it with our blood and sweat. It is now up to you to keep it. And I want the Iraqis to be in fact patrolling Baghdad. If they need vehicles, you let them have the vehicles. But I want them patrolling their city and putting their lives at risk. MR. BLITZER: Thank you. Well \u2014 REP. TANCREDO: Then we move out. MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman. I want to go to the next question. (Applause.) I want to go back to Tom. Tom, go ahead. MR. FAHEY: Thanks. Senator Brownback, President Bush has stated that states that sponsor terrorism are no different than terrorists themselves. Yet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently met with Iranian officials to discuss security in Iraq. Iran is a known supporter of Hezbollah, Hamas. Did President Bush make the right call in opening a dialogue with Iran? SEN. BROWNBACK: I think he made a right call on saying that about terrorist states, particularly Iran. But I think we have to at times talk with them in different situations, like before we went into Afghanistan, we talked with Iran. It wasn\u2019t we were negotiating. We didn\u2019t open up formal diplomatic relations, and we shouldn\u2019t. Iran is the lead sponsor of terrorism. Ahmadinejad just this past week called for the destruction of Israel, continues to call for attacking of the United States. On Iraq, I think we need to talk with him. I think we have to confront them aggressively for what they are, which is the lead sponsor of terrorism in the world. I think we need to push the sanctions forward more aggressively. I think we need to more equip the labor union movement that\u2019s developing inside of Iran; they had a bus driver strike that recently took place. And I think we have to show that purpose and resolve \u2014 that we\u2019re going to confront these guys, and we\u2019re going to stand with our allies like Israel, we\u2019re going to stand against them oppressing and pushing us and trying to fund terrorists against us. MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman. Congressman Hunter, let me bring \u2014 SEN. BROWNBACK: Senator, if you don\u2019t mind. MR. BLITZER: \u2014 excuse me \u2014 senator. SEN. BROWNBACK: That\u2019s okay. MR. BLITZER: Congressman Hunter, let me bring you back in. Do you agree with Senator Brownback that President Bush made the right decision in opening a direct dialogue with Iran? REP. HUNTER: With two conditions, and I think that you do have a dialogue with everybody, whether they\u2019re adversaries or friends. The two conditions are: number one, they are moving deadly equipment across the border that is killing Americans in Iraq. We have license to utilize anything that we want to use \u2014 special operations, intelligence, whatever it takes \u2014 to stop that deadly equipment from moving across the border and hitting Americans in Iraq, and we don\u2019t give that up with these talks. Secondly, they\u2019ve got about a thousand centrifuges now working, enriching the materials that can make at some point a nuclear device. The United States reserves the right to preempt, and we may have to preempt that nuclear weapons program. We cannot allow them to have a nuclear device. With those two caveats, talk to your enemies. MR. BLITZER: If it came down to a preemptive U.S. strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facility, if necessary would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons? REP. HUNTER: I would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to preempt those particular centrifuges. When the Osirak reactor that was hit `86, when the six F-18s came over the horizon and knocked that out, they didn\u2019t need anything but conventional weapons. Probably it\u2019s going to take a little more than that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to take tactical nukes. MR. BLITZER: What do you think, Mayor? Do you think if you were president of the United States and it came down to Iran having a nuclear bomb, which you say is unacceptable, you would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons? MR. GIULIANI: Part of the premise of talking to Iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the United States that they have nuclear power. I think it could be done with conventional weapons, but you can\u2019t rule out anything and you shouldn\u2019t take any option off the table. And during the debate the other night, the Democrats seemed to be back in the 1990s. They don\u2019t seem to have gotten beyond the Cold War. Iran is a threat, a nuclear threat, not just because they can deliver a nuclear warhead with missiles. They\u2019re a nuclear threat because they are the biggest state sponsor of terrorism and they can hand nuclear materials to terrorists. And we saw just last week in New York an attempt by Islamic terrorists to attack JFK Airport; three weeks ago, an attempt to attack Fort Dix. MR. BLITZER: Thank you. MR. GIULIANI: These are real problems. This war is not a bumper sticker. This war is a real war. MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor. (Applause.) Let me bring Governor Gilmore in. What do you say about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons if that\u2019s what it takes to go deep underground and destroy those Iraqi facilities? MR. GILMORE: One of the central problems of the Middle East is the desire for Iran to dominate that portion of the world because of what they are doing. And that is why I believe that they are seeking this kind of nuclear capacity. That is one of the reasons why we are, in fact, in Iraq. And that\u2019s why our soldiers, when they fight and die there, are, in fact, serving the interests of the United States. Nobody ought to have any doubt about that. With respect to Iran, the policy I would follow would be dual. Number one, we need to work with our European allies in order to put in appropriate sanctions. We need to communicate directly with the Iranians that we are going to offer them an opportunity to work with us. But we\u2019re also going to say that having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. They need to understand it. And all options are on the table by the United States in that instance. MR. BLITZER: All right, thank you, Governor. Governor Romney, I want to get you on the record. Do you agree with the mayor, the governor, others here, that the use of tactical nuclear weapons, potentially, would be possible if that were the only way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb? MR. ROMNEY: You don\u2019t take options off the table. But what you do is stand back and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Do you see what\u2019s happening in Sudan and Afghanistan, in Iraq and Iraq? All over the world we\u2019re seeing the same thing happening, and that is, people are testing the United States of America. And we have to make sure they understand that we\u2019re not arrogant. We have resolve. And we have the strength to protect our interests and to protect people who love liberty. For that to happen, we\u2019re going to have not just to attack each one of these problems one by one, but say, \u201cHow do we help move the world of Islam so that the moderate Muslims can reject the extreme?\u201d And for that to happen, we\u2019re going to have to have a strong military and an effort to combine with our allies in such a way \u2014 MR. BLITZER: Thank you. MR. ROMNEY: \u2014 that we combine for an effort to help move Islam towards modernity. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to do instead of looking at each theater one by one and saying: We\u2019ll bomb here, we\u2019ll attack here, we\u2019ll go to Sudan. MR. BLITZER: Thank you. MR. ROMNEY: I watched the Democrats. They don\u2019t think there\u2019s a war on terror. MR. BLITZER: Thank you. MR. ROMNEY: There is a war going on, and we need a broad response to make sure that these people have a different vision. MR. BLITZER: All right. Thank you, Governor. (Applause.) All of you are going to have an opportunity to weigh in on all of these questions as well. If you\u2019re hearing some sounds out there, it\u2019s lightning here in Manchester, New Hampshire. Those are the crackling sounds that you\u2019re hearing. Let\u2019s go back to Scott. MR. SPRADLING: Thanks, Wolf. Congressman Tancredo, let\u2019s talk immigration. REP. TANCREDO: Okay. MR. SPRADLING: You opposed the immigration reform compromise calling it, quote, \u201cthe worst piece of legislation to come down the pike in a long time.\u201d Just this morning, in Manchester, you vowed to oust any senator who supports the bill, including possibly New Hampshire\u2019s senior senator, Judd Gregg, who\u2019s undecided, and says to your comments that you are part of the \u201cno nothing\u201d wing of the political spectrum. In the meantime, the president says his plan is the \u201clast best chance\u201d for serious immigration reform. He\u2019s criticized conservatives for being obstructionists. With that tension at stake, if this becomes law, what are the consequences for the country? REP. TANCREDO: They are incredible and they are disastrous. And that is exactly why I have said what I\u2019ve said, and that is why I have consistently tried to impress upon the American public the seriousness of this issue. We\u2019re not just talking about the number of jobs that we may be losing, or the number of kids that are in our schools and impacting our school system, or the number of people that are abusing our hospital system and taking advantage of the welfare system in this country \u2014 we\u2019re not just talking about that. We\u2019re talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation \u2014 whether or not we will actually survive as a nation. And here\u2019s what I mean by that. What we\u2019re doing here in this immigration battle is testing our willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of Balkanized pieces. We are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the English language, something that is the glue that is supposed to hold us together as a nation. We are becoming a bilingual nation, and that is not good. And that is the fearful part of this. It has \u2014 the ramifications are much, much more significant than any that we\u2019ve been discussing so far. And so yes, I have said dramatic things. And yes, I am willing to do what is ever (sic) necessary to try to stop this piece of legislation, and that includes go after any Republican that votes for it, because the Republicans can stop this. MR. BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman. (Applause.) Mayor Giuliani, what do you think the consequences for the nation are if this immigration plan proposed by President Bush goes through? MR. GIULIANI: The problem with this immigration plan is it has no real unifying purpose. It\u2019s a typical Washington mess. It\u2019s \u2014 everybody compromises, four or five compromises, and the compromises leave you with the following conclusion. The litmus test you should have for legislation is, is it going to make things better? And when you look at these compromise, it is quite possible it will make things worse. The organizing purpose should be that our immigration laws should allow us to identify everyone who is in this country that comes here from a foreign country. They should have a tamper-proof ID card. It should be in a database that allows you to figure out who they are, why they\u2019re here, make sure they\u2019re not illegal immigrants coming here for a bad purpose, and then to be able to throw out the ones who are not in that database. We can do that. Credit card companies \u2014 MR. BLITZER: Thank you. MR. GIULIANI: \u2014 take care of data that is greater than that. MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor. I want to get to Senator McCain in a moment. But first, Governor Romney, Senator McCain has accused you of flip-flopping on this issue, in effect. Yesterday in Miami, he said the following: \u201cPandering for votes on this issue while offering no solution to the problem amounts to doing nothing, and doing nothing is silent amnesty.\u201d What do you say to Senator McCain? MR. ROMNEY: Well, he\u2019s my friend. He campaigned for me two times and I consider him a friend. I\u2019m not going to make this a matter of personal politics. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s way too important for that. My view is that we should enforce immigration laws. And this bill, unfortunately, has at least one provision that\u2019s a real problem. It\u2019s the Z visa. And what it allows is people who\u2019ve come here illegally to stay here for the rest of their lives. Not necessarily as citizens; they have to wait 13 years to become citizens. That\u2019s not the point. The point is, every illegal alien, almost every one, under this bill gets to stay here. That\u2019s not fair to the millions and millions of people around the world that would love to come here \u2014 MR. BLITZER: All right. MR. ROMNEY: \u2014 and join with family members, bring skill and education that we need. It\u2019s simply not fair to say those people get put ahead in the line of all the people who\u2019ve been waiting legally to come to this country. MR. BLITZER: All right. (Applause.) Senator or McCain, this is your chance. I\u2019d like you \u2014 I\u2019d like you to respond as someone who is the co-author of this legislation. SEN. MCCAIN: Well, first of all, I agree with Judd Gregg. He\u2019s a great senator. (Applause.) Second of all, Rudy you just described our legislation, so I\u2019d be glad to have further conversation with you because it does account for people who are here illegally, it does have an employment verification system, and it weeds out those who shouldn\u2019t be here, and it gives others a chance to remain in this country. Look, this is a national security issue first and foremost. Ever since 9/11 it\u2019s a national security issue. People came to Fort Dix, New Jersey from across our Southern border and tried to kill our soldiers. For us to do nothing is silent and defacto amnesty. What we have done is what you expect us to do, my friends, and that\u2019s come together with the president of the United States, the leader of our party, Democrat and Republican, conservative Republicans like Jon Kyl, Johnny Isakson, Saxby Chambliss and Trent Lott, and sit down and figure out an approach to this problem. And it is a serious national security problem. We need to act, my friends, and if someone else has a better idea, I\u2019d love to have them give it to us. (Cheers, applause.) MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Hold on. SEN./REP./MR. : I have a better idea. SEN. MCCAIN: That \u2014 that will get the support of enough people so that we can pass legislation. This isn\u2019t the bill that I would have written, but it does \u2014 MR. BLITZER: All right. Thank you. SEN. MCCAIN: \u2014 it does satisfy our national security challenges, which are severe and intense, and we can not allow 12 million people \u2014 MR. BLITZER: Thank you. SEN. MCCAIN: \u2014 washing around America illegally, my friends. And I hope you\u2019ll examine the legislation \u2014 MR. BLITZER: Okay. Thank you, Senator. SEN. MCCAIN: \u2014 and I hope we can move forward with it, and we can make it better. MR. BLITZER: All right. SEN. MCCAIN: But it\u2019s our job to do the hard things, not the easy things. (Cheers, applause.) MR. BLITZER: Mayor, go ahead. MR. GIULIANI: I\u2019ve read the 400 pages, and this is part of the problem in Washington \u2014 they say things and then it\u2019s not in the legislation. There are four or five different methods of identification, not one. It does not provide information about who exited the United States. Now tell me how you\u2019re going to figure out who\u2019s in the United States, if you can\u2019t figure out who\u2019s left the United States. And finally, it doesn\u2019t provide for a uniform database. Many countries have this. The United States doesn\u2019t have it. On September 11th, when we tried to figure out who was in this country, it took weeks to figure out who were the right people and who weren\u2019t, because there isn\u2019t such a database. MR. BLITZER: Mayor, thank you. MR. GIULIANI: And that is a fatal flaw in this legislation, and wishing it away doesn\u2019t make it possible. MR. BLITZER: Thank you. (Applause.) Governor Romney, what would you do with the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are right now in this country? MR. ROMNEY: Well, one is to enforce the law as it exists. The law that was passed in 1986 \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the law passed in 1986 asked for us to secure the border and said also to put in place an employment verification system. Neither one of those was done. So let\u2019s make sure that we enforce the law as it exists. And if you want to improve this bill, well, one thing you could do to make it better is to take that Z visa and make it temporary, instead of a permanent right to stay in America. That\u2019s simply just not fair. (Applause.) MR. BLITZER: I want to stay on immigration. Everybody\u2019s going to have a chance to weigh in. But let\u2019s go back to Tom for another question on immigration. MR. FAHEY: Thank you. Congressman Hunter, whether we like it or not, in cities across America, in counties across America, including your district in San Diego, illegal immigrants are doing jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want: working on farms, in hotels, restaurants. If you have your way and they all leave this country, who\u2019s going to fill those jobs? REP. HUNTER: Well, first, I disagree with that premise, because when they made the sweep on the Swift plants \u2014 those were the meat packaging plants in Iowa \u2014 took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago, there were American citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour. Now \u2014 and let me tell you, this is a disastrous bill. And if John McCain is right in saying that this is a national security issue \u2014 and it is, border enforcement \u2014 then the Hunter bill, which was signed by the president on the 26th of October, mandating 854 miles of double fence \u2014 not that scraggly little fence you show on CNN all the time, Wolf, that people get across so easily \u2014 if they get across my fence, we sign them up for the Olympics immediately. (Laughter.) We\u2019ve got a big fence. But 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed. Homeland Security has a billion bucks, cash on hand. It\u2019s been six months, and they\u2019ve done 11 miles. So administration has a case of the slows. And I think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time, put the two together, and the Bush-McCain-Kennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike. MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman. REP. HUNTER: It\u2019s a bad bill. MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman. (Applause.) Senator Brownback, what do you say about this notion of a pathway towards citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now? Under what circumstances would you let them begin that path? SEN. BROWNBACK: I don\u2019t think you create any new paths to citizenship. But I also think you allow them to be able to use paths they would currently qualify for, and to be able to get in the back of the line. And that\u2019s part of leadership and getting something resolved. I think \u2014 you know, we can go on a lot of slogans here. And I\u2019ve been around this issue for a while. I was in Congress in 1994, elected then. We did the first immigration bill I was involved in then, in 1996. You know what, that was as enforcement-only bill in 1996, and we had 7 million undocumented in the country then. We\u2019re at 12 (million) to 20 million now. The point of saying that \u2014 and my colleagues and people up here, everybody is concerned that we get something done and get something right. I think if you do exterior enforcement, border enforcement, you do aggressive interior enforcement, and then you work on a comprehensive solution interior, that\u2019s something that a lot of people are going to be upset with, but that can work and move us forward. And it\u2019s better than not doing anything. MR. BLITZER: Thank you. So you support this pending compromise legislation? SEN. BROWNBACK: If we can hold together those things in it, those things have to be in it. MR. BLITZER: So with \u2014 you\u2019re with \u2014 you\u2019re with Senator McCain? SEN. BROWNBACK: If those things are in it. MR. BLITZER: What about you, Governor Thompson? MR. THOMPSON: Wolf, the first thing you have to do is you got to secure the border. MR. : He didn\u2019t say yes. (Chuckles.) MR. THOMPSON: Securing the border is going to allow everything else to follow. But unless you secure the border, it is not right to give 12 million individuals who have illegal rights into this country status before that border is protected. There should be no amnesty. And this bill, no matter how you cover it, is an amnesty bill. And the people in this country do not believe in that bill, and they believe very much that the best hope for us is to have a secure border, just like Congressman Hunter has been talking about \u2014 MR. BLITZER: Thank you. MR. THOMPSON: \u2014 and every other Republican up here; have a secure border, then move on, but don\u2019t do it the other way. MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Governor. Congressman Paul, I want you to weigh in on this as well. I believe \u2014 and correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 you voted o support that 700-mile fence along the border between the United States and Mexico. Did you? REP. PAUL: I did. MR. BLITZER: What about Canada? Is there a need for a similar fence along the border between the United States and Canada? REP. PAUL: No. No, because that bill \u2014 probably the fence was my weakest reason for doing that, but for other reasons \u2014 to enforce the law \u2014 was important, and border security is important. And we\u2019ve talked about amnesty, which I\u2019m positively opposed to. But one thing that has not been mentioned here, which I think is very, very important \u2014 if you subsidize something, you get more of it. So \u2014 we subsidize illegal immigration, we reward it by easy citizenship, either birthright or amnesty. But we force our states and our local communities to pay for the health care and pay for the education. Why wouldn\u2019t they bring their families? And because of our economic conditions, we do need workers. But if we had a truly free market economy, the illegal immigrants would not be the scapegoat. We would probably need them and they would be acceptable, but because of economic conditions, they have become the scapegoat. MR. BLITZER: Okay. Thank you, Congressman. (Applause.) The other night \u2014 Sunday night, I asked the eight Democratic presidential candidates whether or not they thought English should be the official language of the United States. Only one of them said English should be the official language of the United States. If there\u2019s someone here who doesn\u2019t believe English should be the official language of the United States, please speak up right now. SEN. MCCAIN: (Laughs.) I think it\u2019s fine. I would like to remind you that we made treaties with Native Americans, such as the Navajos in my state, where we respect their sovereignty and they use their native language in their deliberations. It\u2019s not a big deal. But Native Americans are important to me in my state. Everybody knows that English has to be learned if anyone ever wants to move up the economic ladder. That is obvious. And part of our legislation, by the way, is a requirement to learn English. And by the way, 30 percent of the people who are in this country illegally never came across our borders, my friends. They overstayed their visas. That\u2019s why it has to be a comprehensive approach. And I\u2019m proud of the support of the president and his brother, Governor Jeb Bush, who was governor of the state of Florida. People who have to deal with this issue every day understand we have to act, my friends. And we can have our own ways to improve it, but if we don\u2019t address this issue, we are going to pay a heavy price because something bad could happen when 12 million people are in this country illegally \u2014 two million of them having committed serious crimes. (Applause.) MR. BLITZER: I see people raising their hands. But the question was, I\u2019d only like those to speak up who believe that English should not necessarily be the official language of the United States. MR. GIULIANI: (Inaudible.) SEN. MCCAIN: (Inaudible.) MR. BLITZER: Is there anyone else who stands with Senator McCain specifically on that question? MR. GIULIANI: (Laughs.) (I\u2019m not going to give an answer. ?) MR. BLITZER: All right. We\u2019re going to go back to Scott. REP. HUNTER: Wolf, can I speak \u2014 MR. BLITZER: Go ahead, Scott. (Cross talk.) REP. HUNTER: Wolf. (Off mike) \u2014 MR. BLITZER: Scott, go ahead. REP. HUNTER: \u2014 in my district. Can I speak up also? MR. BLITZER: You\u2019ll have an opportunity. Go ahead, Scott. MR. SPRADLING: Okay. This question\u2019s for Governor Gilmore. Conservative credentials is the topic, sir. You\u2019ve gotten a lot of mileage out of lumping Misters Giuliani, McCain and Romney together by calling them \u201cRudy McRomney.\u201d Now with former Senator Fred Thompson likely to join you at the next debate, in your opinion is he conservative enough for America, or are we changing the name now to \u201cRudy McRomneyson\u201d? (Laughter.) MR. GILMORE: Well, we\u2019ve gotten a little mileage out of \u201cRudy McRomney.\u201d I know the mayor one time said that it would make a good ticket. And it would, but it isn\u2019t a conservative ticket. And we don\u2019t know what Fred Thompson is either. I think he\u2019s a fine man. He served in the Senate a term and a half. Let\u2019s see exactly what his views are. I\u2019m coming forward and offering my views as a 40-year battler for conservative values and conservative principles on behalf of the people of the United States, and I have the record to back it up. I\u2019ve been a prosecutor. I\u2019ve been an attorney general. I\u2019ve been a governor. I governed as a conservative. I cut taxes for the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I\u2019ve stood by these principles for years and years. The question is, when Fred Thompson comes into the race, as I believe he will, and maybe even Speaker Gingrich may come into the race, they will have to stand on their records and stand on their credentials and offer their ideas the same way that every person here on the stage is doing. I look forward to that day, and I look forward to the debate. MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Governor. Governor Thompson, is there a need for another Thompson in this race? (Laughter.) MR. THOMPSON: I think that anybody with the Thompson name should get involved if they want to get involved. It\u2019s a great name, he\u2019s a great candidate, and I think it will help the Republican Party to have him in. I just would like to say that if you\u2019re talking about conservatism \u2014 and that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about \u2014 there isn\u2019t a candidate on either side of the aisle that has had as many vetoes as I have. Nobody has reduced taxes as much as I have. And if you\u2019re talking about a reliable conservative, it is THIS Thompson \u2014 Tommy Thompson, not the actor \u2014 MR. BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Governor. MR. THOMPSON: \u2014 that\u2019s the conservative. (Laughter.) MR. BLITZER: Thank you, Governor. Mayor Giuliani, there was some news here today. A Catholic bishop in Rhode Island said some words about your position on abortion, suggesting that it was similar to Pontius Pilate\u2019s personal opposition to Jesus Christ\u2019s crucifixion but allowing it to happen anyway. How does that make you feel when you hear words like that from a Catholic bishop? MR. GIULIANI: Well, you know \u2014 well, a Catholic bishop \u2014 (off mike) \u2014 MR. BLITZER: That\u2019s the lightning that\u2019s having an affect on \u2014 MR. GIULIANI: (Laughs.) Yeah, I know. MR. BLITZER: \u2014 our system. (Laughter, applause.) (Cross talk.) MR. GIULIANI: Look, for someone who went to parochial schools all his life, this is a very frightening thing that\u2019s happening right now. (Laughter.) But the reality is, I respect, you know, the opinion of Catholic \u2014 (off mike) \u2014 religious leaders of all kinds. Religion is very important to me, it\u2019s a very important part of my life. But ultimately, as a \u2014 (off mike) \u2014 I\u2019ve been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law, I\u2019ve got to make the decisions that I think are the right ones in a country like ours. And my view on abortion is that it\u2019s wrong, but that ultimately government should not be enforcing that decision on a woman. That\u2019s \u2014 that is my view that I \u2014 I consult my religion, I consult my reading of the Constitution, I consult my views of what I think are important in a pluralistic society, and the reality that we have to respect the fact that there are people that are equally as religious, equally as moral that make a different decision about this. And should government put them in jail? MR. BLITZER: You made, Governor Romney, this decision on abortion, opposing abortion, relatively recently. Why should conservatives out there, people who oppose abortion believe you? MR. ROMNEY: Well, people can look at my record. I\u2019m not going to apologize for the fact that I became pro-life. I served as governor; as I was governor, as we were debating cloning and as we were debating also embryo farming, I said Roe v. Wade has gone too far. I want to make it very clear that I\u2019m pro-life. People here in New Hampshire have seen that I\u2019ve fought for life. I fought also for a traditional marriage, to keep taxes down, to have education in our schools that includes abstinence education. I\u2019ve fought for English immersion in our schools. I know that I\u2019ve got conservative credentials, and that\u2019s one of the things that brings me to this race. But there\u2019s something bigger in conservatism that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve spoken about, and that is that America is a land of opportunity, and our future is going to be far brighter than our past, not just as we overcome these challenges, but as we take advantage of the new opportunity of the 21st century. MR. BLITZER: Thank you very much, Governor. (Applause.) Let\u2019s go back to Tom for the next question. MR. FAHEY: Thank you. Governor Huckabee, at a previous debate, you and two of your colleagues indicated that you do not believe in evolution. You\u2019re an ordained minister. What do you believe? Is it the story of creation as it is reported in the Bible or described in the Bible? MR. HUCKABEE: It\u2019s interesting that that question would even be asked of somebody running for president. I\u2019m not planning on writing the curriculum for an eighth-grade science book. I\u2019m asking for the opportunity to be president of the United States. But you\u2019ve raised the question, so let me answer it. \u201cIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth.\u201d To me it\u2019s pretty simple, a person either believes that God created this process or believes that it was an accident and that it just happened all on its own. And the basic question was an unfair question because it simply asks us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed \u2014 in my view \u2014 whether there\u2019s a God or not. Well let me be very clear: I believe there is a God. I believe there is a God who was active in the creation process. Now, how did he do it, and when did he do it, and how long did he take? I don\u2019t honestly know, and I don\u2019t think knowing that would make me a better or a worse president. But I\u2019ll tell you what I can tell the country. If they want a president who doesn\u2019t believe in God, there\u2019s probably plenty of choices. But if I\u2019m selected as president of this country, they\u2019ll have one who believes in those words that God did create. And as the words of Martin Luther, \u201cHere I stand. I can do no other.\u201d And I will not take that back. MR. BLITZER: Governor, but \u2014 but \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I think the specific question \u2014 the specific question is do you believe literally it was done in six days and it occurred 6,000 years ago? MR. HUCKABEE: No, I did answer that, Wolf. I said I don\u2019t know. My point is, I don\u2019t know; I wasn\u2019t there. (Laughter.) But I believe whether God did it in six days or whether he did it in six days that represented periods of time, he did it, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. But, you know, if anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate, they are certainly welcome to do it. I don\u2019t know how far they will march that back. But I believe that all of us in this room are the unique creations of a God who knows us and loves us and who created us for his own purpose. MR. BLITZER: Senator Brownback, you \u2014 (applause) \u2014 recently elaborated on your position on this. And I wonder if you\u2019d want to spend 30 seconds and tell our audience out there where you stand on the issue of evolution. SEN. BROWNBACK: I\u2019d be happy to. And it\u2019s interesting that we\u2019re doing this here, at St. Anselm\u2019s, who this \u2014 that saint had a philosophy of faith seeking reason. And that\u2019s the issue that\u2019s missing here, if I could highlight that point, is that I believe that we are created in the image of God for a particular purpose. And I believe that with all my heart. And I\u2019m somebody \u2014 I\u2019ve had cancer in the past. I\u2019ve had a season to really look at this and study it and think about the e "], "triple": ["Iran", "is a known supporter of", "Hezbollah"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Hezbollah", "subject": "Iran"}, "_id": 51326}

The story begins in Cornwall, with Igraine. She is visited by her sister Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, and her father Taliesin, the Merlin of Britain. They tell her about Uther, and say that she has to have his child. She refuses, defending her marriage to Gorlois. Viviane makes her promise to go to London and meet Uther. Gorlois, who has been away until now, returns and offers her the chance to come with him, and she accepts. In London, she and Uther meet, and they suffer from love at first sight, which Gorlois notices. He takes Igraine to Tintagel, and goes to fight Uther. Uther kills Gorlois in battle, and with Merlin&apos;s help, assumes the guise of Gorlois. He sneaks into Tintagel Castle, and sleeps with Igraine, and she conceives Arthur. Uther marries Igraine, and brings Morgaine and Morgause (Igraine&apos;s younger sister) to his court at Caerleon as well. Arthur is born, and grows up at court, with Morgaine given the role of sister-babysitter. When Morgaine is around eleven, Viviane comes to Caerleon because Arthur recives a head injury and her healing skillz are needed. She notices Morgaine, and tests her for the Sight. When she finds that Morgaine has it, and strongly, she makes plans to take her to Avalon to train as future Lady of Avalon. She heals Arthur and convinces Uther that Morgaine should come to Avalon, and Arthur should go to fostering at a trustworthy and obscure vassal&apos;s court. Morgaine then goes with Viviane to Avalon, and Arthur goes with the Merlin. In Avalon, Morgaine is trained to be a priestess of the Goddess, and learns herb lore, healing, and use of the Sight. Eventually, she takes the priestess-initiation test - she has to go out in the barge of Avalon, and come back, calling the Mists to part so she can return to Avalon. She succeeds, and is made a priestess. Soon, Viviane sends her to call the Mists for an important visitor, who turns out to be her son Galahad, now called Lancelet. They climb the Tor, a holy hill, and at a place where the Mists are thin, they see that a young woman has come through. This is Gwenhwyfar, a girl from the convent on Glastonbury, the isle that occupies the real-world location of Avalon. Lancelet is struck with love at first sight, but Morgaine is offended by Gwenhwyfar&apos;s statements about Avalon and her appearance, like one of the Fairies, and they show her back through the Mists. Soon, the Merlin comes with the news that Uther is dying. They plan for Gwydion to be sent to Dragon Island for the kingmaking, a ceremony where he must play the Young Stag and kill the King Stag, a metaphor for the times when the new king had to kill the old. He must receive the blessing of the Spring Maiden, as well. Morgaine is chosen for the Spring Maiden, in an ancient form of preserving a bloodline marrying sister and brother. Later, they mention how this is done in Egypt, and even in Britain in ancient times. Morgaine plays the goddess of the hunt without knowledge of who the Young Stag is. As part of the ritual, they sleep together, and in the morning, they realize what they have done. Morgaine becomes depressed, and we see no more of Gwydion for a while. Morgaine returns to Avalon, where Viviane introduces her to Kevin the bard, and tells her that she must perform another ritual, creating a scabbard for theHoly Sword of the Mysteries of the Goddess, Excalibur, meaning &apos;cut steel&apos;. The scabbard must protect the bearer from losing a fatal amount of blood. She does, and Gwydion, now called Arthur, comes to receive the sword, with a promise to protect all of Britain, and remember Avalon, who set him on his throne. Arthur invites her to his crowning on the Isle of Glastonbury. Morgaine attends Arthur&apos;s crowning, and discovers that she is pregnant from her time playing the Spring Maiden. Morgause figures this out, and offers her help in casting it out, but Morgaine refuses, but continues to consider it. She returns to Avalon, and gathers the herbs required, but meets the Queen of Fairy, who convinces her to rethink her decision. Morgaine then leaves Avalon, and goes to Orkney, to live with her aunt, Morgause. When she runs from Avalon, she leaves her ritual knife, which is given to all priestesses. Book Two: The High Queen In Orkney, she gives birth to a son, and names him Gwydion, after his father. His birth is hard, and Morgaine is told that she won&apos;t be able to have any more children. Morgause hears Morgaine muttering in her sleep after the birth, and coaxes her to continue talking while still asleep, and discovers that Arthur is the baby&apos;s father. Morgaine realizes what she has told Morgause and threatens to curse her unless she will keep it a secret. Morgause decides she will foster Gwydion at Orkney. Meanwhile, Gwenhwyfar is in the process of being married off to Arthur, with a dowry of horses and the Round Table. Igraine and Lancelet are sent to bring Gwenhwyfar to court for the wedding. Igraine notices that Lancelet looks at Gwenhwyfar the way Uther looked at her when she was married to Gorlois. Meanwhile, Lancelet and Gwenhwyfar are flirting very carefully, so that no one notices, or thinks Gwenhwyfar is unmaidenly. When they reach Caerleon, where Arthur holds court as his father did, Igraine approaches Taliesin, the Merlin, about it, but he says it is too late to do anything without offering offense to Gwenhwyfar&apos;s father, Leodegranz. Soon after, Gwenhwyfar and Arthur are married. Morgaine is at the ceremony, with Morgause, and her husband Lot, and her mother and brother notice her. Arthur presents Morgaine to Gwenhwyfar as a lady-in-waiting, after the ceremony, and Morgaine agrees. In the summer, a few years after, Morgaine tries to take Lancelet&apos;s mind off Gwenhwyfar, but Lancelet offends her, and in the morning, she leaves Caerleon. Soon after, Viviane is called to the home of Priscilla, the woman who fostered her son Balan as the twin of her own son Balin. Priscilla, being very ill and very old, asks Viviane to help her, and Viviane gives her a potion to kill her. Balin and Balan return, and Balin is extremely angry at Viviane, comparing her to Judas, as they both betrayed with a kiss. Viviane returns to Avalon, and using Niniane, another daughter of Taliesin, as a vessel for the Sight, asks about Morgaine. Niniane says that Morgaine &quot;. .sleeps inthe arms of the grey king..&quot; (Bradley 350) Later, Gwenhwyfar travels to Cornwall, because Igraine is dying. Gwenhwyfar asks Igraine to use her Sight, or any magic she has to help her conceive, because she is barren, and Igraine says that Gwenhwyfar is pregnant now. After Igraine&apos;s death and burial, Gwenhwyfar asks the Abbess of the convent where Igraine lived to pray for her child. Gwenhwyfar sets out to Caerleon, but Gawaine finds them, telling them that he was supposed to take them to Camelot because of an impending battle, but they were well past the road for it, so they went on to Caerleon. When Gwenhwyfar arrives, there is an army, and people are talking about banners. Gwenhwyfar is angry that the &quot;. .sign of an ancient Devil-faith..&quot; (368), the Pendragon banner bearing the serpents of Avalon, fly above an army that should be Christian. She begins work on a banner of the Virgin Mary, to replace it, and convinces Arthur to carry this instead of the Pendragon banner. He was sworn to carry the Serpents of Avalon as a sign of an ancient Britain, and when he took up Gwenhwyfar&apos;s banner, some of the Tribes who followed the rule of Avalon left his army. While Arthur is in battle, Kevin the bard comes to play for Gwenhwyfar and her ladies, but Gwenhwyfar is ill, and shouts at Kevin about how his Druidism was a sin, and she miscarries. Arthur, carrying her banner of the Virgin Mary, wins the battle.

(AP) -- Tom Udall still wears cowboy boots under his business suits, a habit that reflects his upbringing in a ranching family that once drove cattle across territorial New Mexico. Udall helped extend his family&apos;s long tradition of environmentalism and public service Tuesday by defeating Republican Rep. Steve Pearce in the race to represent New Mexico in the Senate. &quot;Conservation is the legacy of the Udall family,&quot; Udall said when he entered the race with his father watching from across the podium. The Udalls have been called the Kennedys of the West. Udall is the son of Stewart Udall, who headed the Interior Department under Presidents Johnson and Kennedy, and the nephew of Arizona Rep. Mo Udall, who served in the House for three decades. And he&apos;s the cousin of Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat who also won a Senate seat on Tuesday. Tom Udall succeeds New Mexico&apos;s longest-serving senator, Republican Pete Domenici, who announced his retirement after 36 years in the Senate when he was diagnosed with a degenerative brain disease. With Udall&apos;s election, New Mexico will be represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since 1973. &quot;The desire for change was palpable among the people of New Mexico,&quot; Udall told The Associated Press after hearing he won the race. &quot;They want New Mexico to move in a new direction.&quot; Born in Tucson, Udall grew up in Arizona and in the Washington, D.C., area. Now 60, he has lived in New Mexico since 1975. He spent a decade in Congress representing the northern part of the state, and he served as New Mexico&apos;s attorney general from 1991 to 1998. Throughout the Senate campaign, Pearce tried to link Udall to extreme environmentalists and liberal big spenders. Udall gained traction toward the end of the campaign by voting twice against a federal bailout package designed to save the troubled economy. He also proposed an ambitious energy plan that included domestic drilling, nuclear power, alternative energy and conservation to make America energy independent. Udall also argued that Pearce voted with the Bush administration 91 percent of the time and supported for tax credits for big oil companies."], "triple": ["Udall", "is the son of", "Stewart Udall"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Stewart_Udall", "subject": "New_Mexico"}, "_id": 109748}

In a memorable scene that has become a metaphor for labor exploitation, the Little Tramp is run through the factory&apos;s enormous gears. For President Hugo Chavez&apos;s socialist government, the film is more than just entertainment: It&apos;s become a teaching tool. Since January, in a bid to expose the evils of &quot;savage capitalism,&quot; the Labor Ministry has shown the Chaplin film to thousands of workers in places such as this rundown industrial suburb of Caracas. When the screenings at factories or meeting halls end, Labor Ministry officials then take their cue, and use Chaplin&apos;s plight to spell out worker rights under occupational safety laws passed last year and now being applied. They are part of Chavez&apos;s sweeping reform agenda that he calls Socialism for the 21st Century. Chaplin wanted his Depression-era movie to make a point, that &quot;once inside the factory, workers had no meaningful rights,&quot; said Los Angeles-based film historian and Chaplin authority Richard Schickel. &quot;It was very relevant in the moment it was released, a time of social unrest and the emerging U.S. labor movement.&quot; Seventy years later, Chaplin&apos;s fable is all too relevant in Venezuela, said several factory workers who saw the film recently. &quot;The owners still value their machines more than their workers,&quot; said Roberto Maldonado, a 29-year-old minimum-wage worker at the Pollo Premium poultry plant, which processes 75,000 chickens a day. &quot;Charlie Chaplin ends up crazy, and I feel that way too sometimes. When I go home, I&apos;m too tired to pay attention to my wife or family.&quot; Freddy Colmenari, a 35-year-old worker at a pasta factory here, said that just as Chaplin&apos;s bosses do in the film, his supervisors frequently speed up the assembly line to nerve-racking levels and zealously monitor workers&apos; trips to the bathroom. &quot;There is always pressure and stress,&quot; he said. But the business community here is hardly applauding the film. In a formal complaint to Chavez last month, the four main employer associations in Venezuela said that showing a movie depicting the boss as a &quot;vulgar exploiter of workers&quot; was designed to &quot;generate hate and resentment in the labor sector&quot; and &quot;demonize the employer.&quot; An official at the Venezuelan Confederation of Industries, one of the four signatories, said that the new workplace laws were another example of Chavez punishing private industry, a process the groups say has been unrelenting since a failed 2002 coup led by businessman Pedro Carmona. While insisting they don&apos;t oppose workplace safety improvements, business groups here say that they weren&apos;t consulted before the new laws were drafted and that now workers and their delegates have too much power to intervene in factory operations. Jhonny Picone, a top Labor Ministry official, said employees needed all the power they could get. He noted that Venezuelan workers were more likely to describe their job as &quot;a curse from God than as something positive.&quot; The grim and dehumanizing factory conditions depicted in the Chaplin film are still the &quot;norm,&quot; he said - more than 1,500 workers die and thousands are injured annually in industrial accidents. Largely at Picone&apos;s insistence, the film has been shown 1,000 times in 14 states and has been effective in educating workers who usually have no clue about their health and safety rights. Labor Ministry officials say it&apos;s because the most recent workplace regulations, passed in 1986, were unobserved, a &quot;dead letter.&quot; Workers are told they have a right to demand safety and hygiene precautions, and, through an employee-elected delegate that represents each factory, even to shut down production if owners don&apos;t comply. Egregious and repeated safety violations can result in the government taking over a plant. &quot;With Charlie Chaplin, it&apos;s easier to catch the attention of workers who are often too tired or don&apos;t trust the government in the first place,&quot; said Picone, a doctor named by Chavez to head a new Labor Ministry agency that he compared to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The workplace laws are a facet of Chavez&apos;s often-mentioned goal of installing a new socialist economic model to replace the globalized free-market version that the president says has failed. The &quot;popular economy&quot; model includes a return to state-controlled central planning that reminds many of the Soviet era. Bankrolled by the country&apos;s oil wealth, Chavez has financed a number of worker-owned cooperatives that run factories and farms that the government has built or taken over. &quot;It&apos;s by no means dominant yet. It&apos;s gradually being built up by a process of trial and error,&quot; said a Chavez administration official who asked not to be named. &quot;But in the longer term, the popular economy model will be dominant.&quot; But one industrial leader who asked not to be identified said that the business climate was abysmal, and that factory production, industrial jobs and private investment had plummeted since Chavez took power in 1999. &quot;How much of this policy is revolution and how much is castigation, I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said. Critics say Chavez is merely recycling the failed protectionist economic policies that many South American nations tried to impose after World War II to keep out foreign capital and competition. The policies were largely jettisoned in the 1980s as countries began embracing free markets and foreign investment. Business interests also cite Chavez&apos;s decision to pull Venezuela out of the Andean Community as another example of his bias against the private sector. The regional trade group, known as CAN, was too U.S.-dominated, the president said. But one member, Colombia, is Venezuela&apos;s second-largest trading partner, and businesspeople here are worried that they will lose tens of millions of dollars in trade as a result. On Tuesday, Venezuela formally joined the Mercosur trade bloc, whose members include Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Chavez told delegates in Caracas, Venezuela&apos;s capital, that he made the switch to avoid being &quot;devoured by imperialist strategies, as happened with CAN.&quot; But Venezuelan producers will have a tougher time competing in the Mercosur arena, said Jose Luis Betancourt, president of Fedecamaras, Venezuela&apos;s largest business chamber. He criticized the new workplace measures. &quot;The law will only generate less efficiency, less [industrial] capacity and make the Venezuelan economy more dependent on high oil prices, which won&apos;t last all our lives.&quot; Chavez&apos;s adversaries in the business sector scoff at the Chaplin film screenings as an example of the president&apos;s simplistic, outdated and decidedly business-unfriendly economic policies. But for poultry plant worker Maldonado, Charlie Chaplin has made a difference at work. Inspired by the film and the talk from Labor Ministry officials, he demanded gloves and soap from his employer - and got them. But the assembly line still goes too fast, he said. Metalworker Miguel Moreno also has seen some improvement. &quot;We have more power because we know more,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;ve given me earplugs for the noise, at least.&quot; Film historian Schickel said, &quot;Chaplin would just love that his film is still relevant to modern social conditions, that a modern-day leftist politician in Latin America would find this film to be a useful tool.&quot;"], "triple": ["Chavez", "told delegates in", "Caracas"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Caracas", "subject": "President_of_the_United_States"}, "_id": 20543}

Otherwise you will leave me now,\u201d Gohan answered. \u201cThis is HELL!\u201d Raditz howled against the onslaught of Gohan\u2019s memories and thoughts whispering around him.\u00a0\u00a0More images of Gohan\u2019s life filled the once dark place, shining and glittering with love and happiness through the sorrow. \u201cMaybe.\u00a0\u00a0But perhaps your soul will learn better that way. That hatred is not the answer,\u201d Gohan continued, rubbing his aching forehead. Leaning down he saw the body of his brother slowly stirring.\u00a0\u00a0Gently he pressed two fingers to Goten\u2019s neck and nodded. His brother was alive. Son Goku had not come close to killing him. Then he turned to his father.\u00a0\u00a0Battered and bruised, Goku lay twisted on one side, his SS4 form vanished.\u00a0\u00a0Leaning down Gohan caressed his father\u2019s cheek.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry Father. It was the only way. You\u2019ll understand why.\u201d A weak groan came from Goku\u2019s lips.\u00a0\u00a0Still blind he blinked sightless eyes up. \u201cG\u2026Gohan is that you?\u201d \u201cQuiet now.\u00a0\u00a0Just lay still,\u201d Gohan answered, crouching by Goku\u2019s battered body. \u201cYou\u2026 is that you?\u201d \u201cWhat does your heart tell you, Father?\u201d Gohan asked.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt tells me to trust you,\u201d Goku answered.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGo do what you have to, Gohan. Don\u2019t worry about me. My part\u2019s done for now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see you, Father,\u201d Gohan said softly, leaning down to embrace his father gently.\u00a0\u00a0Turning to Goten, he carefully picked up his brother as the boy struggled to regain consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0 Pride filled Goku\u2019s heart as he saw his son blast off.\u00a0\u00a0In great pain Goku lay back, his eyes closed while his body slowly repaired itself. Gohan had done what he had anticipated.\u00a0\u00a0Although his bones were shattered they were slowly knitting back together.\u00a0\u00a0Well he understood things, Goku realized.\u00a0\u00a0In hours Son Goku would be that much stronger from his brush with death. *** Goten found himself being carried.\u00a0\u00a0Slowly he swam to consciousness and blinked up into the face of his brother.\u00a0\u00a0Gohan set him down gently on a bed of grass and knelt at a cautious distance.\u00a0\u00a0As Goten swam to consciousness he heard a loud shout of alarm.\u00a0\u00a0The sweet high voice of Bra filled his ears, merging with that of Gohan. \u201cGohan, what happened?\u201d Bra cried. \u201cWe need to help Goten.\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s in a bad way,\u201d Gohan answered.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDo you have your car?\u201d \u201cYes but\u2026\u201d \u201cWe need to drive Goten to Capsule corps. But I can\u2019t stop to help him\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Bra said. \u201cIt might be dangerous. Goten isn\u2019t himself,\u201d said Gohan. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. I can handle him,\u201d Bra laughed lightly.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPapa\u2019s been training me.\u201d \u201cJust to be safe,\u201d Gohan answered.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m getting him into the lab first. There\u2019s something we need to do.\u201d Goten felt the motion of his brother again picking him up.\u00a0\u00a0He smelled the sweet scent of Bra\u2019s perfume and her feminine Saiyan aura.\u00a0\u00a0His heart sped up and skipped beats sensing her near.\u00a0\u00a0A cool hand pressed to his cheek, lightly caressing it.\u00a0\u00a0Gohan\u2019s steps were measured and steady as he heard the transition of them from the lawn to a hard floor.\u00a0\u00a0Echoes around him and the slam of a door told Goten they were inside a building. \u201cMom has a lab here in the basement, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, Gohan,\u201d Bra said voice tinged with worry. \u201cGood thinking,\u201d Gohan said, voice filled with something resembling pride.\u00a0\u00a0Goten willed himself to lie still, squeezing his eyes shut.\u00a0\u00a0Then he felt his body lowered to something flat but comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0Hands untied and removed his shoes, and loosened his collar and tight clothing fastenings.\u00a0\u00a0Then something sharp was pressed into his upper arm and he felt his muscles go rigid. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019ll give me enough time to rig something together to keep him under control,\u201d Gohan answered. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy do you think, bra? Goten\u2019s been overcome by something. Just like Trunks was\u2026\u201d \u201cYou mean\u2026.\u201d \u201cI need you to watch over him and take him to Capsule because I can\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0There your mom and you can treat him.\u00a0\u00a0But he can\u2019t be allowed to speak or try and convince you otherwise,\u201d said Gohan. \u201cI\u2019m not a weakling! Just cause I\u2019m a girl doesn\u2019t mean,\u201d Bra started. \u201cYou\u2019re not an experienced fighter like Pan,\u201d Gohan cut her off. \u201cHell yes I\u2019m not like her, but still don\u2019t you dare say that...\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u00a0\u00a0I got enough of a beating from little brother as it is.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m not used to fighting so much,\u201d Gohan answered.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd it\u2019s time that I changed that.\u201d \u201cGohan, where\u2019s your dad?\u201d \u201cI\u2026 I had no choice, Bra. He\u2019s\u2026 I had to leave him behind,\u201d Gohan answered. \u201cWhat?\u201d Bra\u2019s voice escalated to a near scream. \u201cBra please,\u201d Gohan hushed her. The sounds of fizzling and a smell of charring plastic and metal filled Goten\u2019s nostrils.\u00a0\u00a0Then soft small sounds of things being brought together and the thump of Gohan\u2019s weighted fighting boots on the floor explained the story.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously his brother was building something. \u201cGohan, what happened? What did you do?\u201d \u201cHe was trying to kill Goten.\u00a0\u00a0I had to stop him,\u201d said Gohan. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t mean GOKU was possessed!\u201d Bra gasped. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough to jump to any conclusions.\u00a0\u00a0But I do know that Uub was knocked out, and the way Goten was acting was irrational.\u00a0\u00a0Not to mention the way dad was acting.\u00a0\u00a0So I had to take him out\u2026 as quickly and painlessly as I could,\u201d said Gohan. \u201cBut you can\u2019t be serious! How do I know you\u2019re not affected too?\u201d Bra wailed. \u201cI\u2019m not, you\u2019ll have to trust me,\u201d Gohan answered, his voice cold. \u201cBra,\u201d whispered Goten as he blinked.\u00a0\u00a0Something dark fell over him and he felt cold metal clicking around his wrists and ankles.\u00a0\u00a0Something buzzed and crackled around him, charging the air with ozone.\u00a0\u00a0His muscles twitched as he squirmed and tossed his head. \u201cYou sound so heartless; it\u2019s your own brother and father!\u201d Bra shouted. \u201cPlease Bra\u2026 you know I can bring my father back with the dragon balls!\u201d Gohan hissed. \u201cBut\u2026 but\u2026\u201d \u201cHe should be unable to move with the ki restraints. I\u2019ll load him into the car and you can drive him to capsule.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve got to get back and stop your father from killing your brother,\u201d said Gohan. \u201cWHAT?\u00a0\u00a0NO\u2026.\u201d \u201cBra, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll do my best to stop them,\u201d said Gohan. \u201cBut you can\u2019t help by wanting to tag along.\u00a0\u00a0I have to do this alone.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d Bra yelled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, please just do as I say,\u201d Gohan answered, pleading in his voice.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour mother would understand\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m calling her RIGHT now then, because I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing!!!\u201d \u201cI have to go now, Bra. Please just take care of him,\u201d Gohan answered.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going to hurt Daddy or Trunks are you?\u201d \u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d Gohan\u2019s faint answer echoed.\u00a0\u00a0Then a door slammed and he heard the percussive click of Bra\u2019s stiletto heels on the lab floor.\u00a0\u00a0The musical chime of a cell phone opening followed it and the clicking beep of her thump punching keys. \u201cMommy?\u00a0\u00a0Thank Kami! Mommy I don\u2019t\u2019 know what to do!\u201d Bra chattered anxiously as Goten slowly blinked open his eyes to focus on her.\u00a0\u00a0She stood with her back to him, and he saw the curve of her body pleasing and graceful to his eyes. *** Gohan\u2019s blue ki surged brightly, blazing its own trail desperately towards where he sensed the ki of Vegeta and Trunks.\u00a0\u00a0Narrowing his perceptions to the limit he then discerned the flagging ebbs of them.\u00a0\u00a0They were rapidly dwindling, telling Gohan that the battle was going for the worse.\u00a0\u00a0As the region of ruined ground came into view he saw two figures wrestling and volleying bolts of energy.\u00a0\u00a0No longer were they flying, but simply beating on one another with their bare hands, or gloves. Two suits of armor were cracked and broken, gloves and spandex torn as Vegeta punched Trunks. Trunks body exploded with a sphere of power, flinging Vegeta into a far wall.\u00a0\u00a0Then he pounced on his fallen father with a loud cry.\u00a0\u00a0Biting his lip, Gohan swooped down.\u00a0\u00a0Just as Trunks reached for Vegeta\u2019s battered form Gohan\u2019s fist intercepted it. \u201cENOUGH!\u201d Gohan shouted. Trunks crumpled to the ground, a bruise forming from where Gohan\u2019s fist had hit. \u201cDon\u2019t you interfere, you fool!\u201d Trunks gritted struggling to his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. He\u2019s half DEAD!\u201d Gohan pointed to Vegeta, who was drawing in raspy breaths. \u201cThis is not your concern, brat!\u201d Trunks answered harshly.\u00a0\u00a0Gohan could swear the life force was wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you two have going but it ends NOW!\u201d Gohan shouted, his ki flaring blue. \u201cSo be it, fool.\u00a0\u00a0Interrupt at your peril!\u201d Trunks snarled, his own ki flaring as his body surged into ss2. \u201cYou can\u2019t win, Trunks. You\u2019re not strong enough,\u201d Gohan cautioned, dodging a blow hurled his way.\u00a0\u00a0Trunks shot out with the flat of one hand, then slammed his glowing fist right into Gohan\u2019s face.\u00a0\u00a0However Gohan caught the wrist, and twisted around, hurling Trunks over his head. Slowly, shakily Vegeta pressed gloved hands to the ground and shakily tottered to his knees.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo\u2026 how dare you stop me\u2026 whoever you are!\u201d he rasped.\u00a0\u00a0Clenching his fist, he generated a blue glow to his hand.\u00a0\u00a0 Gohan\u2019s head darted back to the direction of the Saiyan Prince.\u00a0\u00a0Something in the way he formed his words sounded like his Prince, yet the angered tone tinged with surprise suggested otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0As if Vegeta had no clue who he was for he did not call Gohan by name.\u00a0\u00a0Although he turned, a second later a ki ball exploded in his face, knocking him off balance enough.\u00a0\u00a0Vegeta staggered forwards, holding his hand up in a familiar pose.\u00a0\u00a0Still his hair glistened gold from Super Saiyan energies, despite the haggard look of exhaustion in the teal eyes. \u201cYou\u2026 how DARE you interfere!\u201d Vegeta repeated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDamn it,\u201d Gohan sighed.\u00a0\u00a0He raised his hand to deflect the next blast, realizing the Saiyan Prince still had fight in him. Still fresh, Gohan turned partly around with an upraised to block any attack from the fallen Trunks.\u00a0\u00a0Gohan\u2019s friend did not carry himself in a familiar manner as he struggled to stand, snarling through clenched teeth.\u00a0\u00a0For a second in shadow Gohan could see what appeared to be Vegeta\u2019s features superimposed on him. Blinking, Goku\u2019s elder son wondered how he\u2019d seen that.\u00a0\u00a0He presumed that only Uub could perceive spirits possessing others.\u00a0\u00a0The sizzling crash of Vegeta\u2019s second ki ball deflected from his hand, but his temporary gaze snapping towards the Prince indicated something else.\u00a0\u00a0For an instant he swore Vegeta stood much taller, with an imperial beard covering his chin and a mustache on his upper lip.\u00a0\u00a0Vegeta had shaved any such moustache off a while ago when Bra had informed him how stupid it looked. \u201cYou can see them too,\u201d whispered a familiar voice in Gohan\u2019s head.\u00a0\u00a0He recognized it as the Supreme Kai. \u201cYou\u2026 have you been watching all this?\u201d Gohan asked.\u00a0\u00a0He formed words carefully in his mind as Piccolo had taught him years ago in the desert.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBlast you, fall!\u201d Vegeta hollered, hurling more ki blasts towards him. Reflexively Gohan batted them off, but a few lucky shots crashed into him, knocking him over. The mystic warrior landed on one knee, repelling the next volley with both hands.\u00a0\u00a0Again he sensed the alien presence, realizing Vegeta\u2019s eyes did not recognize him.\u00a0\u00a0Inside his mind the Supreme Kai\u2019s voice telepathed, \u201cYes.\u00a0\u00a0You need to stop them now before they kill one another.\u201d \u201cNo fear of that. They\u2019re almost too weak to stand,\u201d said Gohan sadly. Trunks staggered, holding his stomach as he limped with one upraised hand. \u201cCan\u2019t let you interfere,\u201d he grunted.\u00a0\u00a0His fingers glowed blue, then gold.\u00a0\u00a0Gohan barely noticed till he saw the blast out of the corner of his eye. \u201cThat we agree on!\u201d Vegeta chorused, his own hands cupping together.\u00a0\u00a0A large ki ball fizzled into life, growing in intensity.\u00a0\u00a0Simultaneously he unleashed it. Both missiles crashed towards Gohan, who barely raised his hands to deflect both blasts. \u201cGohan, look out!\u201d shouted a voice from above.\u00a0\u00a0Someone dropped between him and Trunks, suddenly deflecting the blast leashed on him.\u00a0\u00a0Another figure stood near him, at waist height hurling a blast to intercept the one that Vegeta tossed towards him.\u00a0\u00a0When his vision cleared of the huge flash he saw Pan standing between him and the Saiyan prince, while Uub covered Trunks. \u201cYou two, what are you doing here?\u201d Gohan asked. Hands cupped over one shoulder, Trunks snarled, \u201cGALLIC GUN!\u201d Lighting cascaded from around him, channeling down his arms into a scarlet beam.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait, its Vegeta!\u201d Uub gasped, dodging out of the way. \u201cSaving your butt dad, what else?\u201d Pan chimed in. \u201cGohan, they\u2019re not themselves,\u201d said Uub. A second later he shouted, \u201cKAMEHAMEHA!\u201d The resulting blue blast surged from his cupped hands, zinging past Trunks.\u00a0\u00a0Snarling Trunks uttered, \u201cI don\u2019t need your stinking help! Get out of here!\u201d \u201cI know, I can see,\u201d Gohan narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou can?\u201d asked Uub. \u201cBegone!\u201d howled Vegeta, bringing his hands together.\u00a0\u00a0A bright sphere formed, hurtling towards the three fighters. \u201cThink fast!\u201d Pan shouted.\u00a0\u00a0Gohan shoved her down as he swung a punch over her head, knocking Vegeta\u2019s fist out of the way. \u201cPan, get out of here! It\u2019s too dangerous!\u201d Gohan shouted. \u201cBut Dad\u2026\u201d she protested. \u201cGohan, get the brat out of here now!\u201d Trunks shouted, dodging Uub\u2019s flurry of fists.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is not your affair!\u201d \u201cSorry Vegeta, I can\u2019t!\u201d Gohan answered, realizing that it was Vegeta\u2019s soul speaking through his friend\u2019s mouth. \u201cDad, be careful!\u201d Pan yelled, whirling her arms in quick circles.\u00a0\u00a0Kiko ha blasts fanned out, only to be dodged by both Vegeta and Trunks zigzagging towards them. \u201cGohan, let\u2019s trade!\u201d Uub barked. \u201cFine by me,\u201d Gohan said. \u201cEither way we have to stop this!\u00a0\u00a0Pan, cover me!\u201d Another blast slammed past them, and Pan dove to the left. Uub\u2019s leg shot out in a kick, slamming into Vegeta\u2019s gut.\u00a0\u00a0The Prince flew back, crashing into a ruined building.\u00a0\u00a0Pan dodged the falling rubble as sage watched her father facing off against Trunks. \u201cSorry Trunks, this is for your own good,\u201d Gohan sighed.\u00a0\u00a0Throwing back his fist he slammed it into Trunks jaw.\u00a0\u00a0The youth crumpled into Gohan\u2019s arms, and the warrior sighed as he gathered Trunks into his arms.\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, Uub rocketed around the shattered rubble pile.\u00a0\u00a0Pan orbited the opposite way, guessing that her companion was anticipating Vegeta\u2019s next move.\u00a0\u00a0At the last minute pieces of it exploded as the Saiyan Prince surfaced, roaring loudly.\u00a0\u00a0His hands were thrown out at the level of his head, blue lightening crackling over his body. \u201cNOW!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0shouted Uub, cupping his hands at his waist. Pan nodded, doing the same.\u00a0\u00a0Together they surged with blue light, their voices chorusing, \u201cKA\u2026 mee\u2026\u201d \u201cYou will DIE for interfering!\u201d Vegeta vowed, though it was clear to all of them it was the long dead King of Vegetasei\u00a0\u00a0that inhabited the Prince\u2019s body.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cVictory\u2026 FIRE!\u201d \u201cHA ME HA!\u201d Uub yelled.\u00a0\u00a0A fraction of an instant later Pan did the same, her beam sizzling at a 45 degree angle to Uub&apos;s position. Both blue rays slammed into Vegeta before he could finish his own attack.\u00a0\u00a0Propelled backwards, his ki sphere shot up towards the heavens and disappeared harmlessly.\u00a0\u00a0Pan and Uub ceased their beams when Vegeta crashed into another heap of rubble.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell done,\u201d Gohan said as he looked at the two young warriors panting, their hands still posed in the final pose of his father\u2019s signature attack. \u201cHe\u2019s down.\u00a0\u00a0But not dead,\u201d Uub announced. \u201cWho is that?\u201d Pan asked. \u201cThe King of Vegetasei,\u201d Uub answered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh,\u201d Pan shivered, hugging herself. \u201cUub, go and get him.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll carry Trunks. Pan, you follow and keep your senses glued if either one of them so much as blinks,\u201d Gohan ordered.\u00a0\u00a0His daughter nodded.\u00a0\u00a0 Uub strode through the ruined bits of city, his feet crunching road and dust under.\u00a0\u00a0Pan moved to help shift away rocks while Goku&apos;s student dug towards where Vegeta lay.\u00a0\u00a0Hearing a faint rasp he sensed the low ebb of the Prince\u2019s life force and the absence of whatever spirit that had alighted upon him.\u00a0\u00a0For some reason knocking the body unconscious cancelled the hold.\u00a0\u00a0Or rather prevented those able to see such spirits from knowing if they were still present. Carefully the young warrior hefted Vegeta over his shoulders in a fireman carry.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Capsule, shall we?\u201d Gohan asked, slinging Trunks over his shoulders. \u201cAre you sure Dad?\u201d asked Pan, wincing slightly to see Trunks so helpless.\u00a0\u00a0Still she shivered because the mere sight of him evoked unpleasant memories. \u201cYes. Remember Bulma had a special regeneration tank to hold Trunks?\u00a0\u00a0I would imagine she build more than one of them,\u201d Gohan nodded.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight,\u201d Uub said.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut is Goku\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat happened to Grandpa?\u201d Pan inhaled sharply. \u201cHe\u2019ll be all right, I hope,\u201d Gohan said quickly. Pan opened her mouth to protest, but Uub raised a free hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay Pan, I know it will,\u201d he answered. \u201cI hope so\u2026 but still\u2026\u201d \u201cTrust me Pan,\u201d Gohan said.\u00a0\u00a0Pan felt an odd sense of relief to see the look of warmth in her father\u2019s eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Gone was that strange growling undertone to his voice.\u00a0\u00a0Three ki s blazed like trinary stars and the warriors streaked off towards West City in the gloom of the oncoming night.\u00a0\u00a0The blood red disc of the setting sun descended in strips through the red haze of battle thrown up."], "triple": ["Gohan", "pointed to", "Vegeta"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Vegeta", "subject": "Son_Gohan"}, "_id": 41345}

It&apos;s not just the pursuit of wealth that has been common to numerous cultures, but is an activity associated with the rational organization of formally free labor (his italics). Capitalism requires an organized labor force and a ready source of investment capital. Some of these factors were not present in Hindu and Confucian societies. Hinduism, in particular its tradition of caste, prevented the ready organization of the labor force. Also, its emphasis on asceticism focused toward the otherworldly and afterlife, and tended to accentuate the non-material. Trade was highly developed in China as in India, but Confucianism permitted a more material focus.

The &quot;full assurance [Gr. plerophoria, &apos;full bearing&apos;] of faith&quot; (Heb. 10:22) is a fulness of faith in God which leaves no room for doubt. The &quot;full assurance of understanding&quot; (Col. 2:2) is an entire unwavering conviction of the truth of the declarations of Scripture, a joyful steadfastness on the part of any one of conviction that he has grasped the very truth. The &quot;full assurance of hope&quot; (Heb. 6:11) is a sure and well-grounded expectation of eternal glory (2 Tim. 4:7, 8). This assurance of hope is the assurance of a man&apos;s own particular salvation. This infallible assurance, which believers may attain unto as to their own personal salvation, is founded on the truth of the promises (Heb. 6:18), on the inward evidence of Christian graces, and on the testimony of the Spirit of adoption (Rom. 8:16). That such a certainty may be attained appears from the testimony of Scripture (Rom. 8:16; 1 John 2:3; 3:14), from the command to seek after it (Heb. 6:11; 2 Pet. 1:10), and from the fact that it has been attained (2 Tim. 1:12; 4:7, 8; 1 John 2:3; 4:16). This full assurance is not of the essence of saving faith. It is the result of faith, and posterior to it in the order of nature, and so frequently also in the order of time. True believers may be destitute of it. Trust itself is something different from the evidence that we do trust. Believers, moreover, are exhorted to go on to something beyond what they at present have when they are exhorted to seek the grace of full assurance (Heb. 10:22; 2 Pet. 1:5-10). The attainment of this grace is a duty, and is to be diligently sought.&quot;Genuine assurance naturally leads to a legitimate and abiding peace and joy, and to love and thankfulness to God; and these from the very laws of our being to greater buoyancy, strength, and cheerfulness in the practice of obedience in every department of duty.&quot;This assurance may in various ways be shaken, diminished, and intermitted, but the principle out of which it springs can never be lost. their foreheads&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. astrologers&quot;7 times in Dan&quot;and 1 time in &quot;Is&quot; 8 in all,Astrologer (Dan. 1:20; 2:2, 10, 27, etc.) Heb. &apos;ashshaph&apos;, an enchanter, one who professes to divine future events by the appearance of the stars.

It was one of the places re-occupied by the Jews on their return from the Captivity (Neh. 11:30). bar &quot;7 times in the bible K.J.V.&quot;Bar used to denote the means by which a door is bolted (Neh. 3:3); a rock in the sea (Jonah 2:6); the shore of the sea (Job 38:10); strong fortifications and powerful impediments, etc. (Isa. 45:2; Amos 1:5); defences of a city (1 Kings 4:13). A bar for a door was of iron (Isa. 45:2), brass (Ps. 107:16), or wood (Nah. 3:13). bear false witness&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. Beelzebub&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V &quot;Beelzebub (Gr. form Beel&apos;zebul), the name given to Satan, and found only in the New Testament (Matt. 10:25; 12:24, 27; Mark 3:22). It is probably the same as Baalzebub (q.v.), the god of Ekron, meaning &quot;the lord of flies,&quot; or, as others think, &quot;the lord of dung,&quot; or &quot;the dung-god.&quot; befallen&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. beheaded&quot;7 times in the bible K.J.V.&quot;Behead a method of taking away life practised among the Egyptians (Gen. 40:17-19). There are instances of this mode of punishment also among the Hebrews (2 Sam. 4:8; 20:21,22; 2 Kings 10:6-8). It is also mentioned in the New Testament (Matt. 14:8-12; Acts 12:2). besides&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. Bethaven&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;K.J.V.Beth-aven house of nothingness; i.e., &quot;of idols&quot;, a place in the mountains of Benjamin, east of Bethel (Josh. 7:2; 18:12; 1 Sam. 13:5). In Hos. 4:15; 5:8; 10:5 it stands for &quot;Bethel&quot; (q.v.), and it is so called because it was no longer the &quot;house of God,&quot; but &quot;the house of idols,&quot; referring to the calves there worshipped. Bethsaida&quot;7 times in the bible&quot;,K.J.V.&apos;Bethsaida house of fish. (1.) A town in Galilee, on the west side of the sea of Tiberias, in the &quot;land of Gennesaret.&quot; It was the native place of Peter, Andrew, and Philip, and was frequently resorted to by Jesus (Mark 6:45; John 1:44; 12:21). It is supposed to have been at the modern &apos;Ain Tabighah, a bay to the north of Gennesaret. (2.) A city near which Christ fed 5,000 (Luke 9:10; comp. John 6:17; Matt. 14:15-21), and where the blind man had his sight restored (Mark 8:22), on the east side of the lake, two miles up the Jordan. It stood within the region of Gaulonitis, and was enlarged by Philip the tetrarch, who called it &quot;Julias,&quot; after the emperor&apos;s daughter. Or, as some have supposed, there may have been but one Bethsaida built on both sides of the lake, near where the Jordan enters it. Now the ruins et-Tel. Binnui&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. bite&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. blindness&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;Blindness was sometimes a punishment for disobedience (1 Sam. 11:2; Jer. 39:7), sometimes the effect of old age (Gen. 27:1; 1 Kings 14:4; 1 Sam. 4:15). Conquerors sometimes blinded their captives (2 Kings 25:7; 1 Sam. 11:2). Blindness denotes ignorance as to spiritual things (Isa. 6:10; 42:18, 19; Matt. 15:14; Eph. 4:18). The opening of the eyes of the blind is peculiar to the Messiah (Isa. 29:18). Elymas was smitten with blindness at Paul&apos;s word (Acts 13:11). the bottomless pit&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. bough&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. brick&quot;7 times in the bible &quot;KJV&quot;Bricks the making of, formed the chief labour of the Israelites in Egypt (Ex. 1:13, 14). Those found among the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh are about a foot square and four inches thick. They were usually dried in the sun, though also sometimes in kilns (2 Sam. 12:31; Jer. 43:9; Nah. 3:14). buryingplace&quot;7 times in the bible&quot;K.J.V.&quot;Burial The first burial we have an account of is that of Sarah (Gen. 23). The first commercial transaction recorded is that of the purchase of a burial-place, for which Abraham weighed to Ephron &quot;four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchants.&quot; Thus the patriarch became the owner of a part of the land of Canaan, the only part he ever possessed. When he himself died, &quot;his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,&quot; beside Sarah his wife (Gen. 25:9). Deborah, Rebekah&apos;s nurse, was buried under Allon-bachuth, &quot;the oak of weeping&quot; (Gen. 35:8), near to Bethel. Rachel died, and was buried near Ephrath; &quot;and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave&quot; (16-20). Isaac was buried at Hebron, where he had died (27, 29). Jacob, when charging his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, said, &quot;There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah&quot; (49:31). In compliance with the oath which he made him swear unto him (47:29-31), Joseph, assisted by his brethren, buried Jacob in the cave of Machpelah (50:2, 13). At the Exodus, Moses &quot;took the bones of Joseph with him,&quot; and they were buried in the &quot;parcel of ground&quot; which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor (Josh. 24:32), which became Joseph&apos;s inheritance (Gen. 48:22; 1 Chr. 5:1; John 4:5). Two burials are mentioned as having taken place in the wilderness. That of Miriam (Num. 20:1), and that of Moses, &quot;in the land of Moab&quot; (Deut. 34:5, 6, 8). There is no account of the actual burial of Aaron, which probably, however, took place on the summit of Mount Hor (Num. 20:28, 29).Joshua was buried &quot;in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah&quot; (Josh. 24: 30). In Job we find a reference to burying-places, which were probably the Pyramids (3:14, 15). The Hebrew word for &quot;waste places&quot; here resembles in sound the Egyptian word for &quot;pyramids.&quot;Samuel, like Moses, was honoured with a national burial (1 Sam. 25:1). Joab (1 Kings 2:34) &quot;was buried in his own house in the wilderness.&quot; In connection with the burial of Saul and his three sons we meet for the first time with the practice of burning the dead (1 Sam. 31:11-13). The same practice is again referred to by Amos (6:10).Absalom was buried &quot;in the wood&quot; where he was slain (2 Sam. 18:17, 18). The raising of the heap of stones over his grave was intended to mark abhorrence of the person buried (comp. Josh. 7:26 and 8:29). There was no fixed royal burying-place for the Hebrew kings. We find several royal burials taking place, however, &quot;in the city of David&quot; (1 Kings 2:10; 11:43; 15:8; 2 Kings 14:19, 20; 15:38; 1 Kings 14:31; 22:50; 2 Chr. 21:19, 20; 2 Chr. 24:25, etc.). Hezekiah was buried in the mount of the sepulchres of the sons of David; &quot;and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death&quot; (2 Chr. 32:33).Little is said regarding the burial of the kings of Israel. Some of them were buried in Samaria, the capital of their kingdom (2 Kings 10:35; 13:9; 14:16).Our Lord was buried in a new tomb, hewn out of the rock, which Joseph of Arimathea had prepared for himself (Matt. 27:57-60; Mark 15:46; John 19:41, 42).The grave of Lazarus was &quot;a cave, and a stone lay on it&quot; (John 11:38). Graves were frequently either natural caverns or artificial excavations formed in the sides of rocks (Gen. 23:9; Matt. 27:60); and coffins were seldom used, unless when the body was brought from a distance. Buy&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. camps&quot;7 times in the bible&quot;KJV&quot;Camp During their journeys across the wilderness, the twelve tribes formed encampments at the different places where they halted (Ex. 16:13; Num. 2:3). The diagram here given shows the position of the different tribes and the form of the encampment during the wanderings, according to Num. 1:53; 2:2-31; 3:29, 35, 38; 10:13-28. The area of the camp would be in all about 3 square miles. After the Hebrews entered Palestine, the camps then spoken of were exclusively warlike (Josh. 11:5, 7; Judg. 5:19, 21; 7:1; 1 Sam. 29:1; 30:9, etc.). careful&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. careth&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. causes&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;Sorry all i can fine,,,Causeway a raised way, an ascent by steps, or a raised slope between Zion and the temple (1 Chr. 26:16, 18). In 2 Chr. 9:11 the same word is translated &quot;terrace.&quot; ceasing&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. certainty&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. Chaldea&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;Chaldea The southern portion of Babylonia, Lower Mesopotamia, lying chiefly on the right bank of the Euphrates, but commonly used of the whole of the Mesopotamian plain. The Hebrew name is Kasdim, which is usually rendered &quot;Chaldeans&quot; (Jer. 50:10; 51:24,35).The country so named is a vast plain formed by the deposits of the Euphrates and the Tigris, extending to about 400 miles along the course of these rivers, and about 100 miles in average breadth. &quot;In former days the vast plains of Babylon were nourished by a complicated system of canals and water-courses, which spread over the surface of the country like a network. The wants of a teeming population were supplied by a rich soil, not less bountiful than that on the banks of the Egyptian Nile. Like islands rising from a golden sea of waving corn stood frequent groves of palm-trees and pleasant gardens, affording to the idler or traveller their grateful and highly-valued shade. Crowds of passengers hurried along the dusty roads to and from the busy city. The land was rich in corn and wine.&quot; Recent discoveries, more especially in Babylonia, have thrown much light on the history of the Hebrew patriarchs, and have illustrated or confirmed the Biblical narrative in many points. The ancestor of the Hebrew people, Abram, was, we are told, born at &quot;Ur of the Chaldees.&quot; &quot;Chaldees&quot; is a mistranslation of the Hebrew Kasdim, Kasdim being the Old Testament name of the Babylonians, while the Chaldees were a tribe who lived on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and did not become a part of the Babylonian population till the time of Hezekiah. Ur was one of the oldest and most famous of the Babylonian cities. Its site is now called Mugheir, or Mugayyar, on the western bank of the Euphrates, in Southern Babylonia. About a century before the birth of Abram it was ruled by a powerful dynasty of kings. Their conquests extended to Elam on the one side, and to the Lebanon on the other. They were followed by a dynasty of princes whose capital was Babylon, and who seem to have been of South Arabian origin. The founder of the dynasty was Sumu-abi (&quot;Shem is my father&quot;). But soon afterwards Babylonia fell under Elamite dominion. The kings of Babylon were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Elam, and a rival kingdom to that of Babylon, and governed by Elamites, sprang up at Larsa, not far from Ur, but on the opposite bank of the river. In the time of Abram the king of Larsa was Eri-Aku, the son of an Elamite prince, and Eri-Aku, as has long been recognized, is the Biblical &quot;Arioch king of Ellasar&quot; (Gen. 14:1). The contemporaneous king of Babylon in the north, in the country termed Shinar in Scripture, was Khammu-rabi. changes&quot;7 times in the bible,Sorry , all I can fine,,Changes of raiment were reckoned among the treasures of rich men (Gen. 45:22; Judg. 14:12, 13; 2 Kings 5:22, 23). childless&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. clusters&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. commend&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. commune&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;All I can Fine,Communion fellowship with God (Gen. 18:17-33; Ex. 33:9-11; Num. 12:7, 8), between Christ and his people (John 14:23), by the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1), of believers with one another (Eph. 4:1-6). The Lord&apos;s Supper is so called (1 Cor. 10:16, 17), because in it there is fellowship between Christ and his disciples, and of the disciples with one another. confessed&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;Confession (1) An open profession of faith (Luke 12:8). (2.) An acknowledment of sins to God (Lev. 16:21; Ezra 9:5-15; Dan. 9:3-12), and to a neighbour whom we have wronged (James 5:16; Matt. 18:15). contain&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. cornet&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;Cornet Heb. shophar, &quot;brightness,&quot; with reference to the clearness of its sound (1 Chr. 15:28; 2 Chr. 15:14; Ps. 98:6; Hos. 5:8). It is usually rendered in the Authorized Version &quot;trumpet.&quot; It denotes the long and straight horn, about eighteen inches long. The words of Joel, &quot;Blow the trumpet,&quot; literally, &quot;Sound the cornet,&quot; refer to the festival which was the preparation for the day of Atonement. In Dan. 3:5, 7, 10, 15, the word (keren) so rendered is a curved horn. The word &quot;cornet&quot; in 2 Sam. 6:5 (Heb. mena&apos;an&apos;im, occurring only here) was some kind of instrument played by being shaken like the Egyptian sistrum, consisting of rings or bells hung loosely on iron rods.

It is the rendering of a word (rakad&apos;) which means to skip or leap for joy, in Eccl. 3:4; Job 21:11; Isa. 13:21, etc.In the New Testament it is in like manner the translation of different Greek words, circular motion (Luke 15:25); leaping up and down in concert (Matt. 11:17), and by a single person (Matt. 14:6).It is spoken of as symbolical of rejoicing (Eccl. 3:4. Comp. Ps. 30:11; Matt. 11: 17). The Hebrews had their sacred dances expressive of joy and thanksgiving, when the performers were usually females (Ex. 15:20; 1 Sam. 18:6).The ancient dance was very different from that common among Western nations. It was usually the part of the women only (Ex. 15:20; Judg. 11:34; comp. 5:1). Hence the peculiarity of David&apos;s conduct in dancing before the ark of the Lord (2 Sam. 6:14). The women took part in it with their timbrels. Michal should, in accordance with the example of Miriam and others, have herself led the female choir, instead of keeping aloof on the occasion and &quot;looking through the window.&quot; David led the choir &quot;uncovered&quot;, i.e., wearing only the ephod or linen tunic. He thought only of the honour of God, and forgot himself. From being reserved for occasions of religious worship and festivity, it came gradually to be practised in common life on occasions of rejoicing (Jer. 31:4). The sexes among the Jews always danced separately. The daughter of Herodias danced alone (Matt. 14:6). Darts,darts,dart&quot;7 times in the bible,,K.J.V.,Dart an instrument of war; a light spear. &quot;Fiery darts&quot; (Eph. 6:16) are so called in allusion to the habit of discharging darts from the bow while they are on fire or armed with some combustible material. Arrows are compared to lightning (Deut. 32:23, 42; Ps. 7:13; 120:4). dash&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. daytime&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V..Sorry All I can find,,,Day The Jews reckoned the day from sunset to sunset (Lev. 23:32). It was originally divided into three parts (Ps. 55:17). &quot;The heat of the day&quot; (1 Sam. 11:11; Neh. 7:3) was at our nine o&apos;clock, and &quot;the cool of the day&quot; just before sunset (Gen. 3:8). Before the Captivity the Jews divided the night into three watches, (1) from sunset to midnight (Lam. 2:19); (2) from midnight till the cock-crowing (Judg. 7:19); and (3) from the cock-crowing till sunrise (Ex. 14:24). In the New Testament the division of the Greeks and Romans into four watches was adopted (Mark 13:35). The division of the day by hours is first mentioned in Dan. 3:6, 15; 4:19; 5:5. This mode of reckoning was borrowed from the Chaldeans. The reckoning of twelve hours was from sunrise to sunset, and accordingly the hours were of variable length (John 11:9).The word &quot;day&quot; sometimes signifies an indefinite time (Gen. 2:4; Isa. 22:5; Heb. 3:8, etc.). In Job 3:1 it denotes a birthday, and in Isa. 2:12, Acts 17:31, and 2 Tim. 1:18, the great day of final judgment. deadly&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. dear&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. debt&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;&apos;Debt The Mosaic law encouraged the practice of lending (Deut. 15:7; Ps. 37:26; Matt. 5:42); but it forbade the exaction of interest except from foreigners. Usury was strongly condemned (Prov. 28:8; Ezek. 18:8, 13, 17; 22:12; Ps. 15:5). On the Sabbatical year all pecuniary obligations were cancelled (Deut. 15:1-11). These regulations prevented the accumulation of debt. degree&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;&apos;all I can find,,,Degrees, Song of song of steps, a title given to each of these fifteen psalms, 120-134 inclusive. The probable origin of this name is the circumstance that these psalms came to be sung by the people on the ascents or goings up to Jerusalem to attend the three great festivals (Deut. 16:16). They were well fitted for being sung by the way from their peculiar form, and from the sentiments they express. &quot;They are characterized by brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [i.e, repetition], and by their epigrammatic style...More than half of them are cheerful, and all of them hopeful.&quot; They are sometimes called &quot;Pilgrim Songs.&quot; Four of them were written by David, one (127) by Solomon, and the rest are anonymous. demanded&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V. destroyer&quot;7 times in the bible,K.J.V.&quot;Destroyer (Ex. 12:23), the agent employed in the killing of the first-born; the destroying angel or messenger of God.

At various times, and from the operation of divers causes, the Jews were separated and scattered into foreign countries &quot;to the outmost parts of heaven&quot; (Deut. 30:4). (1.) Many were dispersed over Assyria, Media, Babylonia, and Persia, descendants of those who had been transported thither by the Exile. The ten tribes, after existing as a separate kingdom for two hundred and fifty-five years, were carried captive (B.C. 721) by Shalmaneser (or Sargon), king of Assyria. They never returned to their own land as a distinct people, although many individuals from among these tribes, there can be no doubt, joined with the bands that returned from Babylon on the proclamation of Cyrus. (2.) Many Jews migrated to Egypt and took up their abode there. This migration began in the days of Solomon (2 Kings 18:21, 24; Isa. 30:7). Alexander the Great placed a large number of Jews in Alexandria, which he had founded, and conferred on them equal rights with the Egyptians. Ptolemy Philadelphus, it is said, caused the Jewish Scriptures to be translated into Greek (the work began B.C. 284), for the use of the Alexandrian Jews. The Jews in Egypt continued for many ages to exercise a powerful influence on the public interests of that country. From Egypt they spread along the coast of Africa to Cyrene (Acts 2:10) and to Ethiopia (8:27). (3.) After the time of Seleucus Nicator (B.C. 280), one of the captains of Alexander the Great, large numbers of Jews migrated into Syria, where they enjoyed equal rights with the Macedonians. From Syria they found their way into Asia Minor. Antiochus the Great, king of Syria and Asia, removed 3,000 families of Jews from Mesopotamia and Babylonia, and planted them in Phrygia and Lydia.(4.) From Asia Minor many Jews moved into Greece and Macedonia, chiefly for purposes of commerce. In the apostles&apos; time they were found in considerable numbers in all the principal cities. From the time of Pompey the Great (B.C. 63) numbers of Jews from Palestine and Greece went to Rome, where they had a separate quarter of the city assigned to them. Here they enjoyed considerable freedom.Thus were the Jews everywhere scattered abroad. This, in the overruling providence of God, ultimately contributed in a great degree toward opening the way for the spread of the gospel into all lands.Dispersion, from the plain of Shinar. This was occasioned by the confusion of tongues at Babel (Gen. 11:9). They were scattered abroad &quot;every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations&quot; (Gen. 10:5, 20,31). The tenth chapter of Genesis gives us an account of the principal nations of the earth in their migrations from the plain of Shinar, which was their common residence after the Flood. In general, it may be said that the descendants of Japheth were scattered over the north, those of Shem over the central regions, and those of Ham over the extreme south. The following table shows how the different families were dispersed:", "Deborah, Rebekah&apos;s nurse, was buried under Allon-bachuth, &quot;the oak of weeping&quot; (Gen. 35:8), near to Bethel. Rachel died, and was buried near Ephrath; &quot;and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave&quot; (16-20). Isaac was buried at Hebron, where he had died (27, 29). Jacob, when charging his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, said, &quot;There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah&quot; (49:31). In compliance with the oath which he made him swear unto him (47:29-31), Joseph, assisted by his brethren, buried Jacob in the cave of Machpelah (50:2, 13). At the Exodus, Moses &quot;took the bones of Joseph with him,&quot; and they were buried in the &quot;parcel of ground&quot; which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor (Josh. 24:32), which became Joseph&apos;s inheritance (Gen. 48:22; 1 Chr. 5:1; John 4:5). Two burials are mentioned as having taken place in the wilderness. That of Miriam (Num. 20:1), and that of Moses, &quot;in the land of Moab&quot; (Deut. 34:5, 6, 8). There is no account of the actual burial of Aaron, which probably, however, took place on the summit of Mount Hor (Num. 20:28, 29)."], "triple": ["Isaac", "was buried at", "Hebron"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Hebron", "subject": "Isaac"}, "_id": 50809}

The former professional bodybuilder made the first round of cuts during the two-day tryout period, but left after admitting his real age of 40 (the cut-off had been 35 for the competition). Later, Wright would sign with WWE and be assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling, where he underwent development and evolved into the Boogeyman persona. In July 2005, vignettes for The Boogeyman began to appear on WWE programming and in October he was introduced to the Smackdown roster by then co-general manager Palmer Cannon. Cannon explained that Wright had been an actor for a TV show that never made it to &quot;the network&quot;. The Boogeyman would soon begin to make regular appearances and would wrestle his first match against Simon Dean in December 2005. Over the next few months, The Boogeyman would show up on Smackdown, and occasionally Raw. He would feud with JBL, which culminated in a victory at the Royal Rumble and Booker T, which included a WrestleMania win, before tearing his bicep. A few months later, promos for The Boogeyman started again, however he never returned to the show.
