# ProjectMLSD - Large Language Models Enable Few Shot Clustering

This repository implements the approach described in "Large Language Models Enable Few Shot Clustering" paper, demonstrating how LLMs can be leveraged for effective clustering tasks with minimal labeled data.

## Overview

The project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to improve clustering performance in few-shot scenarios, where labeled data is scarce. We demonstrate this through multiple applications and datasets:

1. Text Clustering on Banking77 Dataset
2. Text Clustering on CLINC Dataset
3. Entity Canonicalization on OPIEC Dataset
4. Entity Canonicalization on Reverb Dataset
5. Customer Support Application (Practical Use Case)

## Methods

Our approach leverages LLMs to enable effective clustering with minimal labeled examples. Text clustering focuses on grouping similar queries by their underlying intent, applied to Banking77 and CLINC datasets for intent recognition. Entity canonicalization addresses the challenge of mapping different mentions of the same entity to a canonical form, implemented on OPIEC and Reverb datasets. Both tasks benefit from our few-shot LLM methods: keyphrase-based representation enhancement, sentence reformulation , LLM-guided constraint generation, hierarchical clustering with LLM validation, and cluster refinement using LLM-based correction. These techniques significantly outperform traditional clustering methods, especially in low-resource scenarios, and demonstrate practical applications in our customer support system.

For entity canonicalization specifically, we employ a multi-view approach that captures different aspects of entity information:

1. **Context View**: Captures the surrounding text that provides context about the entity
2. **Fact View**: Extracts factual information about the entity using LLM-based property extraction


These complementary views are combined to create a rich entity representation that helps overcome the challenges of ambiguity and variation in entity mentions, leading to more accurate canonicalization with minimal labeled examples.
